It is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea (Pyricularia oryzae Cav.), which in favourable conditions can produce yield losses of up to 100 %. Although rice blast is present wherever rice is cultivated, its intensity (incidence and severity of disease) is highly variable and depends on cropping system and climate.\n\nThe 3 year research project is funded by the European Commission and brings together 10 partners from 5 European countries.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'predicting rice blast disease', 'process-based', 'M5Rules', 'Yoshino'",
