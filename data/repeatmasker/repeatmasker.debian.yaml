summary: screen DNA sequences for interspersed repeats
description: >
  RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed
  repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is
  a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query
  sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which
  all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by
  Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by the program
  cross_match, an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh
  algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed by Warren
  Gish.
