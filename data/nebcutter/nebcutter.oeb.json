It produces a variety of outputs including restriction enzyme maps, theoretical digests and links into the restriction enzyme database, REBASE (http://www.neb.com/rebase). Importantly, its table of recognition sites is updated daily from REBASE and it marks all sites that are potentially affected by DNA methylation (Dam, Dcm, etc.). Many options exist to choose the enzymes used for digestion, including all known specificities, subsets of those that are commercially available or sets of enzymes that produce compatible termini.",
