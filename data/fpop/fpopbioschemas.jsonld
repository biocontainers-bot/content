  "sc:description": "Relational database of the protein functional surfaces identified by analyzing the shapes of binding sites in approximately 42,700 structures, including both holo and apo forms. To identify protein binding sites, we model the shape of a split pocket induced by a binding ligand. This database provides an easily accessible resource for studying functional surfaces, assessing conformational changes between bound and unbound forms and analyzing functional divergence.",
