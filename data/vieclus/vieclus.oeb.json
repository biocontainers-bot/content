We review our general memetic algorithm, VieClus, to tackle the graph clustering problem. A key component of our contribution are natural recombine operators that employ ensemble clusterings as well as multi-level techniques. Lastly, we combine these techniques with a scalable communication protocol, producing a system that is able to compute high-quality solutions in a short amount of time. After giving a description of the algorithms employed, we establish the connection of the graph clustering problem to protein–protein interaction networks and moreover give a description on how the software can be used, what file formats are expected, and how this can be used to find functional groups in protein–protein interaction networks.",

A key component of our contribution are natural recombine operators that employ ensemble clusterings as well as multi-level techniques. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm successfully improves or reproduces all entries of the 10th DIMACS implementation challenge under consideration in a small amount of time. In fact, for most of the small instances, we can improve the old benchmark result in less than a minute. Moreover, while the previous best result for different instances has been computed by a variety of solvers, our algorithm can now be used as a single tool to compute the result.\n\nVieClus - Vienna Graph Clustering is a memetic algorithm",
