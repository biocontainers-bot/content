description: "QuasiRecomb presents a jumping hidden Markov model that describes the\
  \ generation of the viral quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing\
  \ next generation sequencing data. It offers an implementation of the EM algorithm\
  \ to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model parameters and a method to\
  \ estimate the distribution of viral strains in the quasispecies. \n"
