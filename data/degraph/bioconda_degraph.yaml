description: DEGraph implements recent hypothesis testing methods which directly assess
  whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two conditions.
  This is to be contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches which first
  test individual genes, then test gene sets for enrichment in differentially expressed
  genes. These recent methods take into account the topology of the network to yield
  more powerful detection procedures. DEGraph provides methods to easily test all
  KEGG pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data set and tools
  to visualize the results.
