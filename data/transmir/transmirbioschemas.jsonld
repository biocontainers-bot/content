References to the published literature (PubMed ID) information about the organism in which the relationship was found, whether the TFs and miRNAs are involved with tumors, miRNA function annotation and miRNA-associated disease annotation are also included. It provides a user-friendly interface by which interested parties can easily retrieve TF-miRNA regulatory pairs by searching for either a miRNA or a TF.",
