            "abstract": "Protein design aims to identify new protein sequences of desirable structure and biological function. Most current de novo protein design methods rely on physics-based force fields to search for low free-energy states following Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis. A major obstacle of such approaches is the inaccuracy of the force field design, which cannot accurately describe the atomic interactions or distinguish correct folds. We developed a new web server, EvoDesign, to design optimal protein sequences of given scaffolds along with multiple sequence and structure-based features to assess the foldability and goodness of the designs. EvoDesign uses an evolution-profile-based Monte Carlo search with the profiles constructed from homologous structure families in the Protein Data Bank. A set of local structure features, including secondary structure, torsion angle and solvation, are predicted by single-sequence neural-network training and used to smooth the sequence motif and accommodate the physicochemical packing. The EvoDesign algorithm has been extensively tested in large-scale protein design experiments, which demonstrate enhanced foldability and structural stability of designed sequences compared with the physics-based designing methods. The EvoDesign server is freely available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/EvoDesign.",
