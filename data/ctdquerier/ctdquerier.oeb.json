Summary: Biomedical studies currently include a large volume of genomic and environmental factors for studying the etiology of human diseases. R/Bioconductor projects provide several tools for performing enrichment analysis at gene-pathway level, allowing researchers to develop novel hypotheses. However, there is a need to perform similar analyses at the chemicals-genes or chemicals-diseases levels to provide complementary knowledge of the causal path between chemicals and diseases. While the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database™ (CTD) provides information about these relationships, there is no software for integrating it into R/Bioconductor analysis pipelines. CTDquerier helps users to easily download CTD data and integrate it in the R/Bioconductor framework. The package also contains functions for visualizing CTD data and performing enrichment analyses. We illustrate how to use the package with a real data analysis of asthma-related genes. CTDquerier is a flexible and easy-to-use Bioconductor package that provides novel hypothesis about the relationships between chemicals and diseases.",
