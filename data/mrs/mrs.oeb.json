The MRS server allows for very rapid queries in a large number of flat-file data banks, such as EMBL, UniProt, OMIM, dbEST, PDB, KEGG, etc. This server combines a fast and reliable backend with a very user-friendly implementation of all the commonly used information retrieval facilities. The MRS server is freely accessible at http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/. Moreover, the MRS software is freely available at http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/download/ for those interested in making their own data banks available via a web-based server.
