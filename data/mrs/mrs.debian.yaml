summary: Information Retrieval System for Biomedical databanks
description: >
  MRS is a complete system to retrieve, index and query biological and
  medical databanks. It comes with all the code required to fetch data
  using FTP or rsync, then creates a local databank with indices using
  a databank specific parser written in Perl. It can then serve this
  data using a built-in web application and webservices.
  .
  Searching can be done on words and Boolean queries. As a bonus you
  can search protein sequences using a custom Blast algorithm.
