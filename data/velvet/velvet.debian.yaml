summary: Nucleic acid sequence assembler for very short reads
description: >
  Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
  sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
  Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near
  Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
  .
  Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
  high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information, if
  available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
version: 1.2.10
