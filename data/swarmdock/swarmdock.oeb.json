After uploading PDB files of the binding partners, the server generates low energy conformations and returns a ranked list of clustered docking poses and their corresponding structures. The user can perform full global docking, or focus on particular residues that are implicated in binding. The server is validated in the CAPRI blind docking experiment, against the most current docking benchmark, and against the ClusPro docking server, the highest performing server currently available.
