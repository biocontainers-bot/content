        "description": "Construction of competing endogenous RNA networks from paired RNA-seq data sets by pointwise mutual information.\n\nBACKGROUND:A long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to compete with an mRNA for binding to the same miRNA. Such an interplay between the lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA is called a ceRNA crosstalk. As an miRNA may have multiple lncRNA targets and multiple mRNA targets, connecting all the ceRNA crosstalks mediated by the same miRNA forms a ceRNA network. Methods have been developed to construct ceRNA networks in the literature. However, these methods have limits because they have not explored the expression characteristics of total RNAs. RESULTS:We proposed a novel method for constructing ceRNA networks and applied it to a paired RNA-seq data set. The first step of the method takes a competition regulation mechanism to derive candidate ceRNA crosstalks",
