Since version 2.7.0, HiC-Pro can analyse data from digestion protocols as well as data from protocols that do not require restriction enzyme such as DNase Hi-C.\nThe pipeline is flexible, scalable and optimized. It can operate either on a single laptop or on a computational cluster. HiC-Pro is sequential and each step of the workflow can be run independantly.\nHiC-Pro includes a fast implementatation of the ICE normalization method (see the iced python library for more information). In addition, HiC-Pro can use phasing data to build allele specific contact maps.",
