description: 'The Pathway Activity Profiling - PAPi - is an R package for predicting
  the activity of metabolic pathways based solely on a metabolomics data set containing
  a list of metabolites identified and their respective abundances in different biological
  samples. PAPi generates hypothesis that improves the final biological interpretation.
  See Aggio, R.B.M; Ruggiero, K. and Villas-Boas, S.G. (2010) - Pathway Activity Profiling
  (PAPi): from metabolite profile to metabolic pathway activity. Bioinformatics.'
