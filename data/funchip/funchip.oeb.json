Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) generates local accumulations of sequencing reads on the genome (\"peaks\"), which correspond to specific protein- DNA interactions or chromatin modifications. Peaks are detected by considering their total area above a background signal, usually neglecting their shapes, which instead may convey additional biological information. We present FunChIP, an R/Bioconductor package for clustering peaks according to a functional representation of their shapes: After approximating their profiles with cubic B-splines, FunChIP minimizes their functional distance and classifies the peaks applying a kmean alignment and clustering algorithm. The whole pipeline is user-friendly and provides visualization functions for a quick inspection of the results. An application to the transcription factor Myc in 3T9 murine fibroblasts shows that clusters of peaks with different shapes are associated with different genomic locations and different transcriptional regulatory activity.",
