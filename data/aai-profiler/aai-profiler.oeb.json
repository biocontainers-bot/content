        "description": "AAI-profiler [1] is a fast homology search tool that takes a query proteome (protein sequences in FASTA format) as input and plots the AAI (Average Amino-acid Identity) values of species in the Uniprot database. AAI-profiler is powered by SANS [2] and the processing time for a bacterial proteome is a few minutes.",
