summary: R package: DNA copy number data analysis
description: >
  Implements the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to segment DNA
  copy number data and identify genomic regions with abnormal copy number.
  .
  This package is for analyzing array DNA copy number data, which is usually
  (but not always) called array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH)
  data It implements a methodology for finding change-points in these data which
  are points after which the (log) test over reference ratios have changed
  location. This model is that the change-points correspond to positions where
  the underlying DNA copy number has changed. Therefore, change-points can be
  used to identify regions of gained and lost copy number. Also provided is a
  function for making relevant plots of these data.
