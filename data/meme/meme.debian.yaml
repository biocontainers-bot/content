summary: search for common motifs in DNA or protein sequences
description: >
  MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation) is a tool for discovering
  motifs in a group of related DNA or protein sequences.  A motif is a
  sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related protein or
  DNA sequences. MEME represents motifs as position-dependent
  letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each
  possible letter at each position in the pattern. Individual MEME motifs
  do not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps are split by
  MEME into two or more separate motifs.
  .
  MEME takes as input a group of DNA or protein sequences (the training set)
  and outputs as many motifs as requested. MEME uses statistical modeling
  techniques to automatically choose the best width, number of occurrences,
  and description for each motif.
