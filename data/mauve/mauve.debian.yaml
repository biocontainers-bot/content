summary: multiple genome alignment algorithms
description: >
  The mauveAligner and progressiveMauve alignment algorithms have been
  implemented as command-line programs included with the downloadable Mauve
  software.  When run from the command-line, these programs provide options
  not yet available in the graphical interface.
  .
  Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple genome alignments
  in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement
  and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research
  into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning
  whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short
  sequences.
  .
  Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner
  should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic
  techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For
  example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute,
  while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in
  a few hours.
  .
  Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.
  Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome
  alignments that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss,
  indels, and nucleotide substutition.
  .
  Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin.
