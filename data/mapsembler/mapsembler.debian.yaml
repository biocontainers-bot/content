summary: bioinformatics targeted assembly software
description: >
  Mapsembler2 is a targeted assembly software.
  It takes as input a set of NGS raw reads (fasta or fastq, gzipped or not)
  and a set of input sequences (starters).
  .
  It first determines if each starter is read-coherent, e.g. whether reads
  confirm the presence of each starter in the original sequence.
  Then for each read-coherent starter, Mapsembler2 outputs its sequence
  neighborhood as a linear sequence or as a graph, depending on the user choice.
  .
  Mapsembler2 may be used for (not limited to):
   - Validate an assembled sequence (input as starter), e.g. from a de
     Bruijn graph assembly where read-coherence was not enforced.
   - Checks if a gene (input as starter) has an homolog in a set of reads
   - Checks if a known enzyme is present in a metagenomic NGS read set.
   - Enrich unmappable reads by extending them, possibly making them mappable
   - Checks what happens at the extremities of a contig
   - Remove contaminants or symbiont reads from a read set
