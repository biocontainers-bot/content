Although accumulating evidence has demonstrated the antiosteoporotic effect of PCL, the identities of the osteogenic compounds in PCL and their functional targets remain elusive. To investigate the osteogenic ingredients in PCL and their functional mechanisms, network pharmacology analysis was performed on the targets of PCL and osteogenesis. Methods:The active components of PCL were screened by literature review.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SwissTargetPrediction' (bio.tools/swisstargetprediction), 'STITCH' (bio.tools/stitch), 'PCL', 'PCL MC3T3-E1'",
