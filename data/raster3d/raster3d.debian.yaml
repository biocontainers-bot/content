summary: tools for generating images of proteins or other molecules
description: >
  Raster3D is a set of tools for generating high quality raster images of
  proteins or other molecules. The core program renders spheres, triangles,
  cylinders, and quadric surfaces with specular highlighting, Phong shading,
  and shadowing. It uses an efficient software Z-buffer algorithm which is
  independent of any graphics hardware. Ancillary programs process atomic
  coordinates from PDB files into rendering descriptions for pictures composed
  of ribbons, space-filling atoms, bonds, ball+stick, etc. Raster3D can also be
  used to render pictures composed in other programs such as Molscript in
  glorious 3D with highlights, shadowing, etc. Output is to pixel image files
  with 24 bits of color information per pixel.
