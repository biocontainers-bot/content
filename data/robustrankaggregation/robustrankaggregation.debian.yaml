summary: Methods for robust rank aggregation
description: >
  Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of
  genes. It implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al
  in preparation) and some other simple algorithms for the task.
  RRA method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that is
  robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of
  significance probabilities for all the elements in the final
  ranking.
