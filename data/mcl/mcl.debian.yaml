summary: Markov Cluster algorithm
description: >
  The MCL package is an implementation of the MCL algorithm, and offers
  utilities for manipulating sparse matrices (the essential data
  structure in the MCL algorithm) and conducting cluster experiments.
  .
  MCL is currently being used in sciences like biology (protein family
  detection, genomics), computer science (node clustering in
  Peer-to-Peer networks), and linguistics (text analysis).
