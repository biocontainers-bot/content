To achieve this goal, we designed a set of tools under the Galaxy framework to allow biologists to define their own strategy for reproducible biomarker selection. These tools rely on retrieving experimental data from public databases, and applying successive filters derived from information relating to disease pathophysiology. A step-by-step protocol linking these tools was implemented to select tissue-leakage biomarker candidates of myocardial infarction. A list of 24 candidates suitable for experimental assessment by MS-based proteomics is proposed. These tools have been made publicly available at http://www.proteore.org, allowing researchers to reuse them in their quest for biomarker discovery.",
