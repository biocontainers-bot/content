This addition enables ChemPager to predict the cumulative process mass intensity of chemical routes, irrespective of their development status, by comparison with a set of reactions executed on large scale. The prediction of this core green chemistry metric aims to improve existing routes and help the decision-making process among route alternatives without the need for experimental data.",
