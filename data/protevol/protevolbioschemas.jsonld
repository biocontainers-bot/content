  "sc:description": "This program computes the mean-field site-specific amino acid distributions that have minimal differences with respect to the background distribution and that constraint the average stability of the native state of the protein against both unfolding and misfolding. The program also simulates protein evolution subject to the constraint of selection on the folding stability of the native state of the protein against both unfolding and misfolding.",
