We propose to perform a prospective observational study to determine the incidence of ARDS in India. Aim 2: To perform a preliminary assessment of risk factors for ARDS in the Indian trauma population. We will leverage these findings against the global ARDS data to provide a foundation for further interventional studies. Aim 3: To evaluate the current management strategies and patient outcomes from ARDS in trauma subjects admitted to the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC). These findings will identify areas in need of practice-based performance improvement in ARDS therapies in India.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ARDS trauma', 'incidence ARDS trauma'",
