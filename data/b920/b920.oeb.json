        "description": "Drivers of High-Cost Medical Complexity in a Medicaid Population.\n\nBACKGROUND:Efforts to improve outcomes for the 10% of patients using two thirds of health care expenditures increasingly include addressing social determinants. Empiric evidence is needed to identify the highest impact nonmedical drivers of medical complexity and cost. OBJECTIVES:This study examines whether complex, highest cost patients have different patterns of critical life adversity than those with better health and lower utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN:Using a validated algorithm we constructed a complexity cost risk patient profile. We developed and fielded a life experience survey (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http: links.lww.com MLR B920) to a representative sample, then examined how the prevalence of specific adversities varied between complex, high-cost individuals, and others.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'maltreatment', 'Medicaid', 'incarceration', 'adversities'",
