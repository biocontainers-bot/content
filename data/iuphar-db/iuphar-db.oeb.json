As well as providing recommended nomenclature, the database integrates information on the chemical, genetic, functional and pathophysiological properties of receptors and ion channels, curated and peer-reviewed from the biomedical literature by a network of experts. The database now includes information on 616 gene products from four superfamilies in human and rodent model organisms: G protein-coupled receptors, voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and, in a recent update, 49 nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). New data types for NHRs include details on co-regulators, DNA binding motifs, target genes and 3D structures. Other recent developments include curation of the chemical structures of approximately 2000 ligand molecules, providing electronic descriptors, identifiers, link-outs and calculated molecular properties, all available via enhanced ligand pages. The interface now provides intelligent tools for the visualization and exploration of ligand structure-activity relationships and the structural diversity of compounds active at each target. The database is freely available at http://www.iuphar-db.org. Â© The Author(s) 2010.",
