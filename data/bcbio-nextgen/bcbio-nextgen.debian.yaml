summary: toolkit for analysing high-throughput sequencing data
description: >
  This package installs the command line tools of the bcbio-nextgen
  toolkit implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high
  throughput sequencing analysis.
  .
  A high-level configuration file specifies inputs and analysis parameters
  to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution,
  idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps.  The project
  contributes a shared community resource that handles the data processing
  component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time
  to focus on the downstream biology.
