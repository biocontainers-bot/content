summary: Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis
description: >
  MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of
  microbial communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from
  metagenomic shotgun sequencing data with species level resolution. From
  version 2.0, MetaPhlAn is also able to identify specific strains (in the
  not-so-frequent cases in which the sample contains a previously
  sequenced strains) and to track strains across samples for all species.
  .
  MetaPhlAn 2.0 relies on ~1M unique clade-specific marker genes (the
  marker information file can be found at
  usr/share/metaphlan2/utils/markers_info.txt.bz2) identified from
  ~17,000 reference genomes (~13,500 bacterial and archaeal, ~3,500 viral,
  and ~110 eukaryotic), allowing:
  .
   * unambiguous taxonomic assignments;
   * accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance;
   * species-level resolution for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and
     viruses;
   * strain identification and tracking
   * orders of magnitude speedups compared to existing methods.
   * metagenomic strain-level population genomics
