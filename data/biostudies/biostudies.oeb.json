            "abstract": "Â© 2017 The Author(s). BioStudies (www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) is a new public database that organizes data from biological studies. Typically, but not exclusively, a study is associated with a publication. BioStudies offers a simple way to describe the study structure, and provides flexible data deposition tools and data access interfaces. The actual data can be stored either in BioStudies or remotely, or both. BioStudies imports supplementary data from Europe PMC, and is a resource for authors and publishers for packaging data during the manuscript preparation process. It also can support data management needs of collaborative projects. The growth in multiomics experiments and other multi-faceted approaches to life sciences research mean that studies result in a diversity of data outputs in multiple locations. BioStudies presents a solution to ensuring that all these data and the associated publication(s) can be found coherently in the longer term.",
