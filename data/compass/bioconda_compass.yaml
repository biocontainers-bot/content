description: COMPASS is a statistical framework that enables unbiased analysis of
  antigen-specific T-cell subsets. COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework
  to model all observed cell-subsets and select the most likely to be antigen-specific
  while regularizing the small cell counts that often arise in multi-parameter space.
  The model provides a posterior probability of specificity for each cell subset and
  each sample, which can be used to profile a subject's immune response to external
  stimuli such as infection or vaccination.
