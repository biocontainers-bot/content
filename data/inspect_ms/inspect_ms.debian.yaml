summary: mass-spectrometry database search tool
description: >
  Inspect is a MS/MS database search tool specifically designed to address
  two crucial needs of the proteomics comminuty: post-translational
  modification identification and search speed. The program is available
  as a free download or online in the ProteoSAFe webserver. The online
  interface is coordinated with other proteomics software developed in the
  lab, like PepNovo
  .
  Typical database searches do not deal well with the dynamic nature of
  the proteome. Post-translational modifications, alternative splicing,
  and laboratory chemisty all affect protein behavior and make spectrum
  interpretation more challenging. The primary challenge is that the
  "virtual database" of all modified peptides undergoes a combinatorial
  explosion when a broad range of modifications is allowed. This affects
  search running time. A secondary challenge is that in this richer
  database, there are many more close "relatives" for each peptide. This
  affects scoring accuracy, since differentiating between correct and
  incorrect identifications is more difficult.
  .
  InsPecT addresses several algorithmic problems in order to identify
  modified proteins.
  .
  InsPecT uses peptide sequence tags (PSTs) to filter the database.
  InsPecT has an internal tag generator, but can accept tags generated by
  other tools (e.g. Pepnovo, GutenTAG). Because de novo is imperfect,
  multiple tags are produced for each spectrum, to ensure that (at least)
  one tag is corrrect. These PSTs are extremely efficient filters, even in
  the context of up to a dozen possible modifications. Tag-based filtering
  can also be combined with the "two-pass" filtering pioneered by
  X!Tandem, where from one search provides a list of proteins (a mini-
  database) for a more detailed search.
  .
  Unanticipated modifications are common in proteomics. InsPecT implements
  the MS-Alignment algorithm for "blind" spectral search, with no bias
  toward anticipated modification types. This search has been applied to
  annotate heavily-modified proteins such as crystallins.
