There is therefore a pressing need to assist biocuration with automated text mining tools. Here, we describe PubTator, a web-based system for assisting biocuration. PubTator is different from the few existing tools by featuring a PubMed-like interface, which many biocurators find familiar, and being equipped with multiple challenge-winning text mining algorithms to ensure the quality of its automatic results. Through a formal evaluation with two external user groups, PubTator was shown to be capable of improving both the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation. PubTator is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/.",
