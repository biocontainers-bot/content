biotools_id: baalchip
description: The package offers functions to process multiple ChIP-seq BAM files and
  detect allele-specific events. Computes allele counts at individual variants (SNPs/SNVs),
  implements extensive QC steps to remove problematic variants, and utilizes a bayesian
  framework to identify statistically significant allele- specific events. BaalChIP
  is able to account for copy number differences between the two alleles, a known
  phenotypical feature of cancer samples.
