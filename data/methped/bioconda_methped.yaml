description: 'Classification of pediatric tumors into biologically defined subtypes
  is challenging and multifaceted approaches are needed. For this aim, we developed
  a diagnostic classifier based on DNA methylation profiles. We offer MethPed as an
  easy-to-use toolbox that allows researchers and clinical diagnosticians to test
  single samples as well as large cohorts for subclass prediction of pediatric brain
  tumors.  The current version of MethPed can classify the following tumor diagnoses/subgroups:
  Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), Ependymoma, Embryonal tumors with multilayered
  rosettes (ETMR), Glioblastoma (GBM), Medulloblastoma (MB) - Group 3 (MB_Gr3), Group
  4 (MB_Gr3), Group WNT (MB_WNT), Group SHH (MB_SHH) and Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PiloAstro).'
