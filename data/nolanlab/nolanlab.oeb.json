This group has pre-9/11/01 clinical/spirometric data and continues to have serial post-9/11 assessments. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that elevated serum levels of one such LDL byproduct soon after intense WTC dust exposure is a risk factor for developing abnormal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) years later. This development of lung injury is what we call World Trade Center Lung Injury (WTC-LI).\n\nOur group has demonstrated that mediators of Metabolic Syndrome, inflammation and vascular injury in serum sampled within 6 months of 9 11 are predictive of eventual abnormal lung function.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MLI', 'MLI PM-exposed', 'chords', 'MLIactual'",
