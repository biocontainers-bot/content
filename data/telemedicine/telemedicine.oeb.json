This change is creating an ecosystem called connected health, in which telemedicine acquires special importance when distance (not only geographical), is a critical factor. It can respond to financial, social or safety needs or questions of dignity, as is the case with prisoners when they are transferred handcuffed and under custody to hospitals. Bringing health services closer to patients who cannot autonomously travel contributes towards humanising healthcare.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'prison'",
