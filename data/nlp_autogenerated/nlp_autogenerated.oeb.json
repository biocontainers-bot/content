Making Pneumonia Surveillance Easy.\n\nAbstractBackgroundPneumonia (PNU) is the second most common nosocomial infection in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While definitions from CDC were developed to increase the reliability of surveillance data, reduce the burden of surveillance in healthcare facilities, and enhance the utility of surveillance data for improving patient safety - the algorithm is still laborious. We propose an implementation of a refined algorithm script which combines two CDC definitions with the use of natural language processing (NLP), a tool which relies on pattern matching to determine whether a condition of interest is reported as present or absent in a report, to automate PNU surveillance.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
