            "abstract": "Protein methylation is an important and reversible post-translational modification of proteins (PTMs), which governs cellular dynamics and plasticity. Experimental identification of the methylation site is labor-intensive and often limited by the availability of reagents, such as methyl-specific antibodies and optimization of enzymatic reaction. Computational analysis may facilitate the identification of potential methylation sites with ease and provide insight for further experimentation. Here we present a novel protein methylation prediction web server named MeMo, protein methylation modification prediction, implemented in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our present analysis is primarily focused on methylation on lysine and arginine, two major protein methylation sites. However, our computational platform can be easily extended into the analyses of other amino acids. The accuracies for prediction of protein methylation on lysine and arginine have reached 67.1 and 86.7%, respectively. Thus, the MeMo system is a novel tool for predicting protein methylation and may prove useful in the study of protein methylation function and dynamics. The MeMo web server is available at: http://www.bioinfo. tsinghua.edu.cn/~tigerchen/ memo.html. Â© The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
