summary: de novo genome assembler that uses string graphs
description: >
  The major goal of SGA is to be very memory efficient, which is achieved by
  using a compressed representation of DNA sequence reads.
  .
  SGA is a de novo assembler for DNA sequence reads. It is based on Gene Myers'
  string graph formulation of assembly and uses the FM-index/Burrows-Wheeler
  transform to efficiently find overlaps between sequence reads.
