In our software gaps are accounted for when calculating the information content present at each residue position in a multiple alignment. The resulting logo is displayed as a graph consisting of bars, although traditional letter representation is also possible. Amino acids are displayed from the bottom up with decreasing frequencies i.e. the most abundant residue is placed at the bottom of the logo. The bars can be color-coded according to user specifications. Gaps in the alignment are also displayed, either on top or at the bottom of the logo. Furthermore, residues can either be arranged according to their relative abundance or grouped according to user criteria to emphasize the conserved nature of particular positions. Â© The Author 2005.
