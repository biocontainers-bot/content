  "sc:description": "A Monte Carlo computer program is available to generate samples drawn from a population evolving according to a Wright-Fisher neutral model. The program assumes an infinite-sites model of mutation, and allows recombination, gene conversion, symmetric migration among subpopulations, and a variety of demographic histories. The samples produced can be used to investigate the sampling properties of any sample statistic under these neutral models.",
