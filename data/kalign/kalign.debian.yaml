summary: Global and progressive multiple sequence alignment
description: >
  Kalign is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of
  biological sequences. It employs the Muth-Manber string-matching
  algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of the alignment.
  It uses global, progressive alignment approach, enriched by employing
  an approximate string-matching algorithm to calculate sequence
  distances and by incorporating local matches into the otherwise global
  alignment.
