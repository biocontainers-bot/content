The server allows the user to determine a wide variety of conformational parameters in a given structure - such as the identities and rigid-body parameters of interacting nucleic-acid bases and base-pair steps, the nucleotides comprising helical fragments, etc. It is also possible to build 3D models of arbitrary nucleotide sequences and helical types, customized single-stranded and double-helical structures with user-defined base-pair parameters and sequences, and models of DNA 'decorated' at user-defined sites with proteins and other molecules. The visualization component offers unique, publication-quality representations of nucleic-acid structures, such as 'block' images of bases and base pairs and stacking diagrams of interacting nucleotides. The w3DNA web server, located at http://w3dna.rutgers.edu, is free and open to all users with no login requirement.",
