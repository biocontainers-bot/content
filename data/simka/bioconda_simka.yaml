summary: Simka and simkaMin are de novo comparative metagenomics tools. Simka represents
  each dataset as a k-mer spectrum and computes several classical ecological distances
  between them. SimkaMin outputs approximate (but very similar) results by subsampling
  the kmer space and requires much less computational resources.
version: 1.5.1
