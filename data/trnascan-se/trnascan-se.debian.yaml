summary: detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence
description: >
  tRNAscan-SE identifies 99-100% of transfer RNA genes in DNA sequence while
  giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously described
  tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to identify
  candidate tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA covariance
  model. This work represents a practical application of RNA covariance models,
  which are general, probabilistic secondary structure profiles based on
  stochastic context-free grammars. tRNAscan-SE searches at ~ 30 000 bp/s.
  Additional extensions to tRNAscan-SE detect unusual tRNA homologues such as
  selenocysteine tRNAs, tRNA-derived repetitive elements and tRNA pseudogenes.
