summary: resequencing utility that can assemble consensus sequence of genomes
description: >
  For getting ideas on the cause of diseases or their response to
  therapy, and for understanding either for a particular patient,
  doctors around the globe are starting to look at the genes or the
  whole genome and how that sequence is different from a healthy /
  well responding individual.
  .
  SOAPsnp is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis
  Package). The program is a resequencing utility. It assembles the
  consensus sequence for the genome of a newly sequenced individual based
  on the alignment of the raw sequencing reads on a known reference. SNPs
  can then be identified on the consensus sequence through the comparison
  with the reference.
  .
  SOAPsnp uses a method based on Bayes' theorem (the reverse probability
  model) to call consensus genotype by carefully considering the data
  quality, alignment, and recurring experimental errors. All these kinds
  of information was integrated into a single quality score for each base
  in PHRED scale to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. Currently,
  it supports the alignment format of SOAPaligner (soap2).
