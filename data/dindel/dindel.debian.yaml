summary: determines indel calls from short-read data
description: >
  Dindel is a program for calling small indels from short-read sequence
  data ('next generation sequence data'). It currently is designed to
  handle only Illumina data.
  .
  Dindel requires a BAM file containing the read-alignments as input. It
  then extracts candidate indels from the BAM file, and realigns the reads
  to candidate haplotypes consisting of these candidate indels. If there
  is sufficient evidence for an alternative haplotype to the reference,
  it will call an indel.
  .
  It is possible to test indels discovered with other methods using Dindel,
  for instance longer indels obtained through assembly methods. Dindel
  will then realign both mapped and unmapped reads to see if the candidate
  indel is supported by the reads.
  .
  Dindel outputs both genotype likelihoods and includes a script to
  convert these to a VCF file with indel and SNP calls.
  .
  There is basic support for outputting realigned BAM files for each
  realignment-window. These realigned BAM files can be used to call SNPs
  near (candidate) indels.
