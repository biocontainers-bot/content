summary: fast BAM/CRAM depth calculation for WGS, exome, or targeted sequencing
description: >
  mosdepth can output:
  .
   * per-base depth about 2x as fast samtools depth--about 25 minutes of
     CPU time for a 30X genome.
   * mean per-window depth given a window size--as would be used for
     CNV calling.
   * the mean per-region given a BED file of regions.
   * a distribution of proportion of bases covered at or above a given
     threshhold for each chromosome and genome-wide.
   * quantized output that merges adjacent bases as long as they fall in
     the same coverage bins e.g. (10-20)
   * threshold output to indicate how many bases in each region are
     covered at the given thresholds.
  .
  when appropriate, the output files are bgzipped and indexed for
  ease of use.
