summary: multiple structural alignment of proteins
description: >
  Mustang is an algorithm to align multiple protein structures.
  Given a set of PDB files, the program uses the spatial
  information in the Calpha atoms of the set to produce a sequence alignment.
  Based on a progressive pairwise heuristic the algorithm then proceeds
  through a number of refinement passes. Mustang reports the multiple
  sequence alignment and the corresponding superposition of structures.
