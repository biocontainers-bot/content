  "sc:description": "It has a goal of cataloguing all the functional elements in the human genome. The ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) serves as the central repository for ENCODE data. The DCC contains a collection of high-throughput, genome-wide data generated with technologies such as ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNA digestion and others. It includes sequences with quality scores, alignments, signals calculated from the alignments, and in most cases, element or peak calls calculated from the signal data.",
