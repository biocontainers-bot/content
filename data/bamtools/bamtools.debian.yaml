summary: toolkit for manipulating BAM (genome alignment) files
description: >
  BamTools facilitates research analysis and data management using BAM
  files.  It copes with the enormous amount of data produced by current
  sequencing technologies that is typically stored in compressed, binary
  formats that are not easily handled by the text-based parsers commonly
  used in bioinformatics research.
  .
  BamTools provides both a C++ API for BAM file support as well as a
  command-line toolkit.
  .
  This is the bamtools command-line toolkit.
  .
  Available bamtools commands:
   convert  Converts between BAM and a number of other formats
   count    Prints number of alignments in BAM file(s)
   coverage Prints coverage statistics from the input BAM file
   filter   Filters BAM file(s) by user-specified criteria
   header   Prints BAM header information
   index    Generates index for BAM file
   merge    Merge multiple BAM files into single file
   random   Select random alignments from existing BAM file(s), intended more
            as a testing tool.
   resolve  Resolves paired-end reads (marking the IsProperPair flag as needed)
   revert   Removes duplicate marks and restores original base qualities
   sort     Sorts the BAM file according to some criteria
   split    Splits a BAM file on user-specified property, creating a new BAM
            output file for each value found
   stats    Prints some basic statistics from input BAM file(s)
version: 2.5.1
