description: >
  PyMOL is a molecular graphics system targeted at medium to large
  biomolecules like proteins. It can generate high-quality publication-ready
  molecular graphics images and animations.
  .
  Features include:
   * Visualization of molecules, molecular trajectories and surfaces
     of crystallography data or orbitals
   * Molecular builder and sculptor
   * Internal raytracer and movie generator
   * Fully extensible and scriptable via a Python interface
  .
  File formats PyMOL can read include PDB, XYZ, CIF, MDL Molfile, ChemDraw,
