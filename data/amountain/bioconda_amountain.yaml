description: A pure data-driven gene network, weighted gene co-expression network
  (WGCN) could be constructed only from expression profile. Different layers in such
  networks may represent different time points, multiple conditions or various species.
  AMOUNTAIN aims to search active modules in multi-layer WGCN using a continuous optimization
  approach.
