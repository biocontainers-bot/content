BACKGROUND:As longevity increases and our aging population continues to grow, assistive technologies such as exosuits and exoskeletons can provide enhanced quality of life and independence. Exoscore is a design and prototype stage evaluation method to assess factors related to perceptions of the technology, the aim being to optimize technology acceptance. METHOD:In this pilot study, we applied the three-phase Exoscore tool during testing with 11 older adults",
