summary: DNA sequence quality and vector trimming tool
description: >
  Lucy is a utility that prepares raw DNA sequence fragments for sequence
  assembly, possibly using the TIGR Assembler. The cleanup process includes
  quality assessment, confidence reassurance, vector trimming and vector
  removal. The primary advantage of Lucy over other similar utilities is
  that it is a fully integrated, stand alone program.
  .
  Lucy was designed and written at The Institute for Genomic Research
  (TIGR, now the J. Craig Venter Institute), and it has been used here for
  several years to clean sequence data from automated DNA sequencers prior
  to sequence assembly and other downstream uses. The quality trimming
  portion of lucy makes use of phred quality scores, such as those produced
  by many automated sequencers based on the Sanger sequencing method. As
  such, lucy’s quality trimming may not be appropriate for sequence
  data produced by some of the new “next-generation” sequencers.
