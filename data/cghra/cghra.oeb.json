The most powerful algorithms to analyze such data have been freely provided by the scientific community for many years, but combining them is a complex scripting task. Results The cghRA framework combines a user-friendly graphical interface and a powerful object-oriented command-line interface to handle a full aCGH analysis, as is illustrated in an original series of 107 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas. New algorithms for copy-number calling, polymorphism detection and minimal common region prioritization were also developed and validated. While their performances will only be demonstrated with aCGH, these algorithms could actually prove useful to any copy-number analysis, whatever the technique used.",
