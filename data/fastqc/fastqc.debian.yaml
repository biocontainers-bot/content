summary: quality control for high throughput sequence data
description: >
  FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on
  raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
  provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
  impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should
  be aware before doing any further analysis.
  .
  The main functions of FastQC are
   * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
   * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
     be problems
   * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
   * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
   * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
     running the interactive application
