summary: Bayesian Inference of Alignment and Phylogeny
description: >
  BAli-Phy estimates multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees
  from unaligned DNA, amino acid, or codon sequences.  BAli-Phy uses MCMC
  to estimate evolutionary trees, positive selection, and branch lengths
  while averaging over alternative alignments. BAli-Phy can display
  alignment ambiguity graphically in an alignment uncertainty (AU) plot.
  .
  BAli-Phy can also estimate phylogenies from a fixed alignment (like MrBayes
  and BEAST) using substitution models like GTR+gamma.  BAli-Phy automatically
  estimates relative rates for each gene.
