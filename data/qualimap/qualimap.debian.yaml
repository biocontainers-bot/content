summary: evaluating next generation sequencing alignment data
description: >
  Qualimap 2 provides both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a
  command-line interface to facilitate the quality control of alignment
  sequencing data and its derivatives like feature counts.
  .
  Supported types of experiments include:
   * Whole-genome sequencing
   * Whole-exome sequencing
   * RNA-seq (speical mode available)
   * ChIP-seq
  .
  Qualimap examines sequencing alignment data in SAM/BAM files according
  to the features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the
  data that helps to the detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of
  the data and eases decision-making for further analysis.
  .
  Qualimap provides multi-sample comparison of alignment and counts data.
   * Fast analysis accross the reference of genome coverage and nucleotide
     distribution;
   * Easy to interpret summary of the main properties of the
     alignment data;
   * Analysis of the reads mapped inside/outside of the regions provided
     in GFF format;
   * Computation and analysis of read counts obtained from intersectition
     of read alignments with genomic features;
   * Analysis of the adequasy of the sequencing depth in RNA-seq
     experiments;
   * Multi-sample comparison of alignment and counts data;
   * Clustering of epigenomic profiles.
