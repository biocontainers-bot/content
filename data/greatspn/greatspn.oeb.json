Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) is one of the most common form of MS in adults and is characterized by a series of neurologic symptoms, followed by periods of remission. Recently, many treatments were proposed and studied to contrast the RRMS progression. Among these drugs, daclizumab (commercial name Zinbryta), an antibody tailored against the Interleukin-2 receptor of T cells, exhibited promising results, but its efficacy was accompanied by an increased frequency of serious adverse events.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RRMS', 'methodology', 'daclizumab'",
