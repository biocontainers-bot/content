description: CopywriteR extracts DNA copy number information from targeted sequencing
  by utiizing off-target reads. It allows for extracting uniformly distributed copy
  number information, can be used without reference, and can be applied to sequencing
  data obtained from various techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation and
  target enrichment on small gene panels. Thereby, CopywriteR constitutes a widely
  applicable alternative to available copy number detection tools.
