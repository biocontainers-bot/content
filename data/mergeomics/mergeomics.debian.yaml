summary: Integrative network analysis of omics data
description: >
  The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating
  multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics,
  canonical pathways and gene-gene interaction networks to generate
  mechanistic hypotheses. It includes two main parts:
  1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA);
  2) Weighted Key Driver Analysis (wKDA).
