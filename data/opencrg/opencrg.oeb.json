            "abstract": "© MDPI AG. All rights reserved.As mobile mapping systems become a mature technology, there are many applications for the process of the measured data. One interesting application is the use of driving simulators that can be used to analyze the data of tire vibration or vehicle simulations. In previous research, we presented our proposed method that can create a precise three-dimensional point cloud model of road surface regions and trajectory points. Our data sets were obtained by a vehicle-mounted mobile mapping system (MMS). The collected data were converted into point cloud data and color images. In this paper, we utilize the previous results as input data and present a solution that can generate an elevation grid for building an OpenCRG model. The OpenCRG project was originally developed to describe road surface elevation data, and also defined an open file format. As it can be difficult to generate a regular grid from point cloud directly, the road surface is first divided into straight lines, circular arcs, and and clothoids. Secondly, a non-regular grid which contains the elevation of road surface points is created for each road surface segment. Then, a regular grid is generated by accurately interpolating the elevation values from the non-regular grid. Finally, the curved regular grid (CRG) model files are created based on the above procedures, and can be visualized by OpenCRG tools. The experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed approach provided a very-high-resolution road surface elevation model.",
