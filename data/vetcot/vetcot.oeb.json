The VetCOT registry was established in 2013, and includes all trauma cases that present to Veterinary Trauma Centers. Veterinary Trauma Centers are well-resourced veterinary hospitals that are initially identified, then subsequently verified, by the American College of Veterinary and Emergency Critical Care VetCOT (http://vetcot.org/index.php/home/identification-and-verification-process/). As of June 2019, there are > 40,000 dog and cat cases in the registry, 3 publications and 9 ongoing projects utilizing data from the registry. Application materials to utilize VetCOT registry data is available on the VetCOT website (http://vetcot.org/index.php/home/registry-use-materials/)",
