description: 'The scde package implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing
  single-cell RNA-seq data. scde fits individual error models for single-cell RNA-seq
  measurements. These models can then be used for assessment of differential expression
  between groups of cells, as well as other types of analysis. The scde package also
  contains the pagoda framework which applies pathway and gene set overdispersion
  analysis to identify and characterize putative cell subpopulations based on transcriptional
  signatures. The overall approach to the differential expression analysis is detailed
  in the following publication: "Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression
  analysis" (Kharchenko PV, Silberstein L, Scadden DT, Nature Methods, doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2967).
  The overall approach to subpopulation identification and characterization is detailed
  in the following pre-print: "Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through
  pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis" (Fan J, Salathia N, Liu R, Kaeser
  G, Yung Y, Herman J, Kaper F, Fan JB, Zhang K, Chun J, and Kharchenko PV, Nature
  Methods, doi:10.1038/nmeth.3734).'
