summary: software tool to compute gene structure predictions
description: >
  GenomeThreader is a software tool to compute gene structure predictions.
  The gene structure predictions are calculated using a similarity-based
  approach where additional cDNA/EST and/or protein sequences are used to
  predict gene structures via spliced alignments. GenomeThreader was motivated
  by disabling limitations in GeneSeqer, a popular gene prediction program
  which is widely used for plant genome annotation.
version: 1.7.3
