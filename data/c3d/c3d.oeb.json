Motivation The 3D genome architecture influences the regulation of genes by facilitating chromatin interactions between distal cis-regulatory elements and gene promoters. We implement Cross Cell-type Correlation based on DNA accessibility (C3D), a customizable computational tool that predicts chromatin interactions using an unsupervised algorithm that utilizes correlations in chromatin measurements, such as DNaseI hypersensitivity signals. Results C3D accurately predicts 32.7%, 18.3% and 24.1% of interactions, validated by ChIA-PET assays, between promoters and distal regions that overlie DNaseI hypersensitive sites in K562, MCF-7 and GM12878 cells, respectively.",
