The modules, comparative and de novo modelling, have significantly improved back-end algorithms that were rigorously evaluated at the sixth meeting on the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction methods. We were one of four server groups invited to make an oral presentation (only the best performing groups are asked to do so). These two modules allow a user to submit a protein sequence and return atomic coordinates representing the tertiary structure of that protein.

The PROTINFO server enables users to submit a protein sequence and request a prediction of the three-dimensional (tertiary) structure based on comparative modeling, fold generation and de novo methods developed by the authors. In addition, users can submit NMR chemical shift data and request protein secondary structure assignment that is based on using neural networks to combine the chemical shifts with secondary structure predictions.
