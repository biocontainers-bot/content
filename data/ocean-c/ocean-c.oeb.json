By integrating FAIRE-seq and Hi-C, OCEAN-C detects open chromatin interactions enriched by active cis-regulatory elements. We identify more than 10,000 hubs of open chromatin interactions (HOCIs) in human cells, which are mainly active promoters and enhancers bound by many DNA-binding proteins and form interaction networks crucial for gene transcription. In addition to identifying large-scale topological structures, including topologically associated domains and A/B compartments, OCEAN-C can detect HOCI-mediated chromatin interactions that are strongly associated with gene expression, super-enhancers, and broad H3K4me3 domains.",
