We describe the use of this tool in the context of the modeling of bacterial regulatory networks, notably the network of global regulators controlling the adaptation of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation conditions. We show how the modeler, by means of GNA, can define a regulatory network, build a model of the network, determine the steady states of the system, perform a qualitative simulation of the network dynamics, and analyze the simulation results using model-checking tools. The example illustrates the interest of qualitative approaches for the analysis of the dynamics of bacterial regulatory networks. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",
