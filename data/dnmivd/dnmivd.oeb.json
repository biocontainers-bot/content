Overall, DNMIVD mainly contains the following important resources:.\n\nDNA methylation is strongly related to cancer, currently, no resource integratively provides the DNA methylation based diagnostic and prognostic models, e-mQTL (expressionâ€“methylation quantitative trait loci), pathway-meQTL (pathway activity-methylation quantitative trait loci), differentially variable and differentially methylated CpGs, survival analysis, as well as functional epigenetic modules for different cancers, which are valuable information for researchers to explore DNA methylation profile from different aspects in cancer",
