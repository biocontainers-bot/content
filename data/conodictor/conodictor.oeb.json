ConoDictor combines predictions from two complementary approaches-profile hidden Markov models and generalized profiles. Results appear in a browser as tables that can be downloaded in various formats. This application is particularly valuable in view of the exponentially increasing number of conopeptides that are being identified. ConoDictor was written in Perl using the common gateway interface module with a php submission page. Sequence matching is performed with hmmsearch from HMMER 3 and ps-scan.pl from the pftools 2.3 package. ConoDictor is freely accessible at http://conco.ebc.ee. Â© 2012 The Author(s).",
