description: 'A classification algorithm, based on a multi-chip, multi-SNP approach
  for Affymetrix SNP arrays. Using a large training sample where the genotype labels
  are known, this aglorithm will obtain more accurate classification results on new
  data. RLMM is based on a robust, linear model and uses the Mahalanobis distance
  for classification. The chip-to-chip non-biological variation is removed through
  normalization. This model-based algorithm captures the similarities across genotype
  groups and probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate classification.
  NOTE: 100K-Xba only at for now.'
