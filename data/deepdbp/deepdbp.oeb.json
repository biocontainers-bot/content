        "description": "Deep Neural Networks for Identification of DNA-binding Proteins.\n\nAbstract DNA-Binding proteins (DBP) are associated with many cellular level functions which includes but not limited to bodyâ€™s defense mechanism and oxygen transportation. They bind DNAs and interact with them. In the past DBPs were identified using experimental lab based methods. However, in the recent years researchers are using supervised learning to identify DBPs solely from protein sequences. In this paper, we apply deep learning methods to identify DBPs. We have proposed two different deep learning based methods for identifying DBPs: DeepDBP-ANN and DeepDBP-CNN. DeepDBP-ANN uses a generated set of features trained on traditional neural network and DeepDBP-CNN uses a pre-learned embedding and Convolutional Neural Network.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DNA-Binding', 'DeepDBP-CNN', 'DeepDBP-ANN', 'DBPs'",
