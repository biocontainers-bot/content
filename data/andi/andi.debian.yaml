summary: Efficient Estimation of Evolutionary Distances
description: >
  This is the andi program for estimating the evolutionary distance
  between closely related genomes. These distances can be used to rapidly
  infer phylogenies for big sets of genomes. Because andi does not compute
  full alignments, it is so efficient that it scales even up to thousands
  of bacterial genomes.
