  "sc:description": "Efficient algorithm for variant detection that compares DNA sequences directly to one another, without aligning them to the reference genome. When used to analyze exome sequences from family trios, or to compare normal and diseased samples from the same individual, this method produces a dramatically smaller list of candidate mutations than previous methods, without losing sensitivity to detect the true cause of a genetic disease.",
