  is a script able to extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs using one or
  more mate pairs or paired-end libraries, or even a combination.
  .
  SSPACE is built based on SSAKE. Code of SSAKE is changed to be able to
  extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs for multiple paired reads
  libraries.
