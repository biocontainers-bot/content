Development of a freely accessible web server for computation of vibrational and thermal fluctuational dynamics of biomolecules is thus useful for facilitating the relevant studies. We have developed a computer program for computing vibrational normal modes and thermal fluctuational properties of proteins and nucleic acids and applied it in several studies. In our program, vibrational normal modes are computed by using modified AMBER molecular mechanics force fields, and thermal fluctuational properties are computed by means of a self-consistent harmonic approximation method. A web version of our program, MoViES (Molecular Vibrations Evaluation Server), was set up to facilitate the use of our program to study vibrational dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. This software was tested on selected proteins, which show that the computed normal modes and thermal fluctuational bond disruption probabilities are consistent with experimental findings and other normal mode computations. MoVIES can be accessed, at http://ang.cz3.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/prog/norm.pl. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
