            "abstract": "Summary: Automated image processing has allowed cell migration research to evolve to a high-throughput research field. As a consequence, there is now an unmet need for data management in this domain. The absence of a generic management system for the quantitative data generated in cell migration assays results in each dataset being treated in isolation, making data comparison across experiments difficult. Moreover, by integrating quality control and analysis capabilities into such a data management system, the common practice of having to manually transfer data across different downstream analysis tools will be markedly sped up and made more robust. In addition, access to a data management solution creates gateways for data standardization, meta-analysis and structured public data dissemination. We here present CellMissy, a cross-platform data management system for cell migration data with a focus on wound healing data. CellMissy simplifies and automates data management, storage and analysis from the initial experimental set-up to data exploration. Availability and implementation: CellMissy is a cross-platform opensource software developed in Java.
