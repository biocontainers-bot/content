summary: Probabilistic Alignment Kit for DNA, codon and amino-acid sequences
description: >
  PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon
  and amino-acid sequences. It's based on a novel algorithm that treats
  insertions correctly and avoids over-estimation of the number of
  deletion events. In addition, PRANK borrows ideas from maximum
  likelihood methods used in phylogenetics and correctly takes into
  account the evolutionary distances between sequences. Lastly, PRANK
  allows for defining a potential structure for sequences to be aligned
  and then, simultaneously with the alignment, predicts the locations
  of structural units in the sequences.
  .
  PRANK is a command-line program for UNIX-style environments but the
  same sequence alignment engine is implemented in the graphical
  program PRANKSTER. In addition to providing a user-friendly interface
  to those not familiar with Unix systems, PRANKSTER is an alignment
  browser for alignments saved in the HSAML format. The novel format
  allows for storing all the information generated by the aligner and
  the alignment browser is a convenient way to analyse and manipulate
  the data.
  .
  PRANK aims at an evolutionarily correct sequence alignment and often
  the result looks different from ones generated with other alignment
  methods. There are, however, cases where the different look is caused
  by violations of the method's assumptions. To understand why things
  may go wrong and how to avoid that, read this explanation of
  differences between PRANK and traditional progressive alignment
  methods.
