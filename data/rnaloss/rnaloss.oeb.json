Given recently discovered roles played by micro RNA, small interfering RNA, riboswitches, ribozymes, etc., it is important to gain insight into the folding process of RNA sequences. We describe the web server RNALOSS, which provides information about the distribution of locally optimal secondary structures, that possibly form kinetic traps in the folding process. The tool RNALOSS may be useful in designing RNA sequences which not only have low folding energy, but whose distribution of locally optimal secondary structures would suggest rapid and robust folding.
