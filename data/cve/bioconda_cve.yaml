biotools_id: cve
description: Shiny app for interactive variant prioritisation in precision oncology.
  The input file for CVE is the output file of the recently released Oncotator Variant
  Annotation tool summarising variant-centric information from 14 different publicly
  available resources relevant for cancer researches. Interactive priortisation in
  CVE is based on known germline and cancer variants, DNA repair genes and functional
  prediction scores. An optional feature of CVE is the exploration of the tumour-specific
  pathway context that is facilitated using co-expression modules generated from publicly
  available transcriptome data. Finally druggability of prioritised variants is assessed
  using the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb).
