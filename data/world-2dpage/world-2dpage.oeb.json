            "abstract": "Since it was launched in 1993, the ExPASy server has been and is still a reference in the proteomics world. ExPASy users access various databases, many dedicated tools, and lists of resources, among other services. A significant part of resources available is devoted to two-dimensional electrophoresis data. Our latest contribution to the expansion of the pool of on-line proteomics data is the World-2DPAGE Constellation, accessible at http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/. It is composed of the established WORLD-2DPAGE List of 2-D PAGE database servers, the World-2DPAGE Portal that queries simultaneously world-wide proteomics databases, and the recently created World-2DPAGE Repository. The latter component is a public standards-compliant repository for gel-based proteomics data linked to protein identifications published in the literature. It has been set up using the Make2D-DB package, a software tool that helps building SWISS-2DPAGE-like databases on one's own Web site. The lack of necessary informatics infrastructure to build and run a dedicated website is no longer an obstacle to make proteomics data publicly accessible on the Internet. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.
