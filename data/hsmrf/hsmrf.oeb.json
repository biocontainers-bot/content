In the directory 1_simulation_study is code for simulating a number of trees under a time-dependent birth-death process, inferring diversification rates under the HSMRF-based and GMRF-based models, and processing those results. In the directory 2_empirical_analyses is code for the empirical analyses presented in the manuscript. Both directories contain more extensive readme files.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RevBayes' (bio.tools/revbayes), 'HSMRF-based', 'GMRF-based', 'birth-death'",
