        "description": "Identifying Heteroprotein Complexes in the Nuclear Envelope.\n\nThe nucleus is delineated by the nuclear envelope (NE), which is a double membrane barrier composed of the inner and outer nuclear membranes as well as a âˆ¼40-nm wide lumen. In addition to its barrier function, the NE acts as a critical signaling node for a variety of cellular processes, which are mediated by protein complexes within this subcellular compartment. Although fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing protein complexes in living cells, it was recently demonstrated that conventional fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy methods are not suitable for applications in the NE because of the presence of slow nuclear membrane undulations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DC tsMSQ', 'DC'",
