Comparing to currently available tools, bTSSfinder achieves higher accuracy (MCC = 0.86, F 1 -score = 0.93) compared to the next best tool with MCC = 0.59, F 1 -score = 0.79) and covers multiple classes of promoters. Availability and Implementation: bTSSfinder is available standalone and online at http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/btssfinder . Contacts: ilham.shahmuradov@kaust.edu.sa or vladimir.bajic@kaust.edu.sa. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. Motivation: The computational search for promoters in prokaryotes remains an attractive problem in bioinformatics. Despite the attention it has received for many years, the problem has not been addressed satisfactorily. In any bacterial genome, the transcription start site is chosen mostly by the sigma (σ) factor proteins, which control the gene activation. The majority of published bacterial promoter prediction tools target σ 70 promoters in Escherichia coli . Moreover, no σ-specific classification of promoters is available for prokaryotes other than for E. coli .",
