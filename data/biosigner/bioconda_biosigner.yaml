description: Feature selection is critical in omics data analysis to extract restricted
  and meaningful molecular signatures from complex and high-dimension data, and to
  build robust classifiers. This package implements a new method to assess the relevance
  of the variables for the prediction performances of the classifier. The approach
  can be run in parallel with the PLS-DA, Random Forest, and SVM binary classifiers.
  The signatures and the corresponding 'restricted' models are returned, enabling
  future predictions on new datasets. A Galaxy implementation of the package is available
  within the Workflow4metabolomics.org online infrastructure for computational metabolomics.
