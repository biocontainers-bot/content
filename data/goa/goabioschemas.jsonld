The assignment of GO terms to UniProt records is an integral part of UniProt biocuration. UniProt manual and electronic GO annotations are supplemented with manual annotations supplied by external collaborating GO Consortium groups, to ensure a comprehensive GO annotation dataset is supplied to users.",
