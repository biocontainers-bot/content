summary: Chromatin state discovery and characterization
description: >
  ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states.
  ChromHMM can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of
  various histone modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring
  combinatorial and spatial patterns of marks. ChromHMM is based on a
  multivariate Hidden Markov Model that explicitly models the presence or
  absence of each chromatin mark. The resulting model can then be used to
  systematically annotate a genome in one or more cell types. By automatically
  computing state enrichments for large-scale functional and annotation datasets
  ChromHMM facilitates the biological characterization of each state. ChromHMM
  also produces files with genome-wide maps of chromatin state annotations that
  can be directly visualized in a genome browser.
