summary: graphical read alignment viewer for short gene sequences
description: >
  Maqview is graphical read alignment viewer. It is specifically designed
  for the Maq alignment file and allows you to see the mismatches, base
  qualities and mapping qualities. Maqview is nothing fancy as Consed or
  GAP, but just a simple viewer for you to see what happens in a
  particular region.
  .
  In comparison to tgap-maq, the text-based read alignment viewer written
  by James Bonfield, Maqview is faster and takes up much less memory and
  disk space in indexing. This is possibly because tgap aims to be a
  general-purpose viewer but Maqview fully makes use of the fact that a
  Maq alignment file has already been sorted. Maqview is also efficient in
  viewing and provides a command-line tool to quickly retrieve any region
  in an Maq alignment file.
