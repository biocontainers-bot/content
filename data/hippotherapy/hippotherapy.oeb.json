Methods: A systematic mapping review of research of hippotherapy was conducted. Searches of nine databases produced 3,528 unique records; 78 full-text, English-written studies were reviewed, the earliest of which was published in 1998. Data relevant to study aims were extracted electronically from these studies and analyzed using queries and pivot tables. Results: Children with cerebral palsy and physical therapists were most prevalent as participants and providers. Equine movement was hippotherapy's core component and mechanism",
