  "sc:description": "IsoBase is a database identifying functionally related proteins across five major eukaryotic model organisms: yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human. Clusters were computed using the IsoRankN algorithm, which uses spectral methods, to combine sequence and PPI data to produce clusters of functionally related proteins. IsoBase may be browsed for functionally related proteins across two or more species and may also be queried by accession numbers, species-specific identifiers, gene name or keyword.",
