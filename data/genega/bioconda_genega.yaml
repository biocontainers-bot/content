description: R based Genetic algorithm for gene expression optimization by considering
  both mRNA secondary structure and codon usage bias, GeneGA includes the information
  of highly expressed genes of almost 200 genomes. Meanwhile, Vienna RNA Package is
  needed to ensure GeneGA to function properly.
