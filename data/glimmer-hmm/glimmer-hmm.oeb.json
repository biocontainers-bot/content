The C/C++ source code for both is available as open source and is highly reusable due to their modular and extensible architectures. Unlike most of the currently available gene-finders, the programs are re-trainable by the end user. They are also re-configurable and include several types of probabilistic submodels which can be independently combined, such as Maximal Dependence Decomposition trees and interpolated Markov models. Both programs have been used at TIGR for the annotation of the Aspergillus fumigatus and Toxoplasma gondii genomes. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

Although the gene finder conforms to the overall mathematical framework of a GHMM, additionally it incorporates splice site models adapted from the GeneSplicer program and a decision tree adapted from GlimmerM. It also utilizes Interpolated Markov Models for the coding and noncoding models . Currently, GlimmerHMM's GHMM structure includes introns of each phase, intergenic regions, and four types of exons.",
