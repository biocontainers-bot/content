  Pscan finds Over-represented Transcription Factor Binding Site Motifs in
  Sequences from Co-Regulated or Co-Expressed Genes.
  .
  Pscan is a software tool that scans a set of sequences (e.g. promoters)
  from co-regulated or co-expressed genes with motifs describing the
  binding specificity of known transcription factors and assesses which
  motifs are significantly over- or under-represented, providing thus
  hints on which transcription factors could be common regulators of the
  genes studied, together with the location of their candidate binding
  sites in the sequences. Pscan does not resort to comparisons with
  orthologous sequences and experimental results show that it compares
  favorably to other tools for the same task in terms of false positive
  predictions and computation time. The website is free and open to all
  users and there is no login requirement.
