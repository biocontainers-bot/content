ORCAE-AOCC is a branch that is dedicated to the genomes published as part of the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC). The motivation behind the development of the ORCAE platform was to create a knowledge-based website where the research-community can make contributions to improve genome annotations. All changes to any given gene-model or gene description are stored, and the entire annotation history can be retrieved. Genomes can either be set to “public” or “restricted” mode; anonymous users can browse public genomes but cannot make any changes. Aside from providing a user-friendly interface to view genome annotations, the platform also includes tools and information (such as gene expression evidence) that enables authorized users to edit and validate genome annotations. The ORCAE-AOCC platform will enable various stakeholders from around the world to coordinate their efforts to annotate and study underutilized crops.",

The system is build on the wiki philosophy, all modifications to a certain gene are stored and can be found back in the annotation history of that gene. To be able to modify genes however you will need to have a user account. Anonymous users can browse the public genomes but don't have editing rights.\n\nNutrition is at the core of AOCC.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/limani (PSB.UGENT.BE), bio.tools/orcae (BIOINFORMATICS.PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae ; PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae), bio.tools/cornet_arabidopsis (PSB.UGENT.BE)",
