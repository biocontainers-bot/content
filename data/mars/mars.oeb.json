MARS does not require tight thresholds for establishing sequential connectivity or detailed adjustment of these thresholds and it can work with a wide variety of NMR experiments. Using only 13Cα /13Cβ connectivity information, MARS allows automatic, error-free assignment of 96% of the 370-residue maltose-binding protein. MARS can successfully be used when data are missing for a substantial portion of residues or for proteins with very high chemical shift degeneracy such as partially or fully unfolded proteins. Other sources of information, such as residue specific information or known assignments from a homologues protein, can be included into the assignment process. MARS exports its result in SPARKY format. This allows visual validation and integration of automated and manual assignment. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

It can be applied independent of the assignment complexity, it does not require tight thresholds for establishing sequential connectivity or detailed adjustment of these thresholds, it can work with a wide variety of NMR experiments and it is robust against missing chemical shift information. In case of a known 3D structure, residual dipolar couplings can be used to enhance assignment.",
