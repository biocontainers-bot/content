The tools allow normalization, filtering and clustering of microarray data, functional scoring of gene clusters, sequence retrieval, and detection of known and unknown regulatory elements using probabilistic sequence models and Gibbs sampling. All tools are available via different web pages and as web services. The web pages are connected and integrated to reflect a methodology and facilitate complex analysis using different tools. The web services can be invoked using standard SOAP messaging. Example clients are available for download to invoke the services from a remote computer or to be integrated with other applications. All services are catalogued and described in a web service registry. The INCLUSive web portal is available for academic purposes at http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/inclusive.",
