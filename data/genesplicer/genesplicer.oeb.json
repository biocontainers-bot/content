The system has been tested successfully using DNA from two reference organism: the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and human. It was compared to six programs representing the leading splice site detectors for each of these species: NetPlantGene, NetGene2, HSPL, NNSplice, GENIO and SpliceView. In each case GeneSplicer performed comparably to the best alternative, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.",
