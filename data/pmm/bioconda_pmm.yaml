description: The Parallel Mixed Model (PMM) approach is suitable for hit selection
  and cross-comparison of RNAi screens generated in experiments that are performed
  in parallel under several conditions. For example, we could think of the measurements
  or readouts from cells under RNAi knock-down, which are infected with several pathogens
  or which are grown from different cell lines.
