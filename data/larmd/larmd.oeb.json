        "description": "integration of bioinformatic resources to profile ligand-driven protein dynamics with a case on the activation of estrogen receptor.\n\nProtein dynamics is central to all biological processes, including signal transduction, cellular regulation and biological catalysis. Among them, in-depth exploration of ligand-driven protein dynamics contributes to an optimal understanding of protein function, which is particularly relevant to drug discovery. Hence, a wide range of computational tools have been designed to investigate the important dynamic information in proteins. However, performing and analyzing protein dynamics is still challenging due to the complicated operation steps, giving rise to great difficulty, especially for nonexperts. Moreover, there is a lack of web protocol to provide online facility to investigate and visualize ligand-driven protein dynamics",
