        "description": "simple alignment tool for optical systems.\n\nBeamDelta is a tool to help align optical systems. It greatly assists in assembling bespoke optical systems by providing a live view of the current laser beam position and a reference position. Even a simple optical setup has multiple degrees of freedom that affect the alignment of beam paths. These degrees of freedom rise exponentially with the complexity of the system. The process of aligning all the optical components for a specific system is often esoteric and poorly documented, if it is documented at all. Alignment methods used often rely on visual inspection of beams impinging on pinholes in the beam path, typically requiring an experienced operator staring at diffuse reflections for extended periods of time. This can lead to a decline in accuracy due to eye strain, flash blindness as well as symptoms such as headaches and, possibly, more serious retinal damage.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
