summary: mapping single-molecule sequencing reads
description: >
  Basic local alignment with successive refinement (BLASR) is a method
  for mapping single-molecule sequencing reads against a reference genome.
  Such reads are thousands of bases long, with divergence between them
  and the genome being dominated by insertion and deletion error.
version: 5.3.3
