  "sc:description": "A server implementation of the UNRES package for coarse-grained simulations of protein structures with the physics-based UNRES model. It can be used in simulations, including those aimed at protein-structure prediction, without ancillary information from structural databases; however, the implementation includes the possibility of using restraints. Local energy minimization, canonical molecular dynamics simulations, replica exchange and multiplexed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations can be run",
