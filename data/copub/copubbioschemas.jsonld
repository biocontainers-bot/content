It also graphically displays differentially expressed genes and over-represented keywords in a network for better visualization of relationships. Version 5.0 uses a new thesauri. It allows for searching of keywords, provides highlighting and sorting mechanisms and statistics. It searches for indirect relations between genes, pathways, drugs and diseases.",
