summary: integrating PSMs into genome browser visualisations
description: >
  iPiG targets the integration of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) from
  mass spectrometry (MS) peptide identifications into genomic
  visualisations provided by genome browser such as the UCSC genome
  browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
  .
  iPiG takes PSMs from the MS standard format mzIdentML (*.mzid) or in
  text format and provides results in genome track formats (BED and GFF3
  files), which can be easily imported into genome browsers.
