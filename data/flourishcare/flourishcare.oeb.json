        "description": "HELPING OLDER ADULTS FLOURISH IN RURAL COMMUNITIES.\n\nAbstractFlourishing represents living within an optimal range of human functioning. To foster older adults flourishing, our FlourishCare model of care coordination was developed as part of a HRSA Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) to transform PC sites by delivering coordinated services in 6 rural KY counties. FlourishCare is unique in its integration of academic teams, community health teams and mental health specialists within age-friendly primary care health systems. FlourishCare recognizes that many of the largest drivers of health care costs fall outside the clinical care environment. One of the major components of Flourish is the involvement of community health navigators (CHNs), community education coordinators (CECs) and community coalitions working with the health teams to respond to the social determinants of health.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Geriatric', 'GWEP'",
