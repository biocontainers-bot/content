In the field of human genetics, it is normal to perform this combination analysis by hand. We report on GeneSeeker http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/ GeneSeeker/), a web server that gathers and combines data from a series of databases. All database searches are performed via the web interfaces provided with the original databases, guaranteeing that the most recent data are queried, and obviating data warehousing. GeneSeeker makes the same selection of candidate genes as the human geneticists would have performed, and thus reducing the time-consuming process to a few minutes. GeneSeeker is particularly well suited for syndromes in which the disease gene displays altered expression patterns in the affected tissue(s). Â© 2005 Oxford University Press.",
