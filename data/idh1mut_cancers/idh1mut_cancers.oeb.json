METHYLOMES AND TRANSCRIPTOMES VARY ACROSS IDH1 MUTANT CANCERS.\n\nAbstractSince their discovery in gliomas, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (collectively referred to as “IDH1mut”) have been discovered in a variety of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), melanoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. While IDH1mut promotes genomic hypermethylation in all these cancers, glioma remains the only tumor in which IDH1mut is a consistently favorable prognostic marker, for reasons that are unclear. We therefore hypothesized that the pattern of DNA methylation, the resultant transcriptomic profiles, and specific genes suppressed, would all vary among IDH1mut cancers according to tissue of origin.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IDH1mut gliomas', 'IDH1wt cholangiocarcinoma', 'IDH1mut', 'hypermethylated IDH1mut'",
