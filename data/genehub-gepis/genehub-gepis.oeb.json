The vast collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the associated tissue source information provides an attractive opportunity for studying gene expression. Results: To facilitate EST-based expression analysis, we developed GEPIS (gene expression profiling in silico), a tool that integrates EST and tissue source information to compute gene expression patterns in a large panel of normal and tumor samples. We found EST-based expression patterns to be consistent with published papers as well as our own experimental results. We also built a GEPIS Regional Atlas that depicts expression characteristics of all genes in a selected genomic region. This program can be adapted for large-scale screening for genes with desirable expression patterns, as illustrated by our large-scale mining for tissue- and tumor-specific genes. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

Using aggregated expressed sequence tag (EST) library information and EST counts, the application calculates the normalized gene expression levels across a large panel of normal and tumor tissues, thus providing rapid expression profiling for a given gene. The backend GeneHub component of the application contains pre-defined gene structures derived from mRNA transcript sequences from major databases and includes extensive cross references for commonly used gene identifiers. ESTs are then linked to genes based on their precise genomic locations as determined by GMAP. This genome-based approach reduces incorrect matches between ESTs and genes, thus minimizing the noise seen with previous tools. In addition, the gene-centric design makes it possible to add several important features, including text searching capabilities, the ability to accept diverse input values, expression analysis for microRNAs, basic gene annotation, batch analysis and linking between mouse and human genes. GeneHub-GEPIS is available at http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/genentech/genehub-gepis/or http://www.gepis.org/. © 2007 The Author(s).",
