The association between the development of postoperative acute kidney injury and the implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to examine the relationship between the implementation of an enhanced recovery pathway and the development of postoperative acute kidney injury.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'recovery', 'enhanced recovery', 'enhanced', 'postoperative acute kidney injury'",
