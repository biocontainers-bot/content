summary: straight-forward trimming of FASTQ sequences
description: >
  This package is a simplistic contribution to the wealth of tools for
  trimming of sequences of current Next-Generation-Sequencing data. It
  was developed in the context of de novo whole-genome assembly.
  .
  The tool reads from the 3'-end and extract reads (or read pairs) of good
  quality. If the reads are paired, the filtering is done pairwise, and
  if one read in a pair has low quality, the remaining read is saved as
  single end.
