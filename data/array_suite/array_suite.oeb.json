            "abstract": "Â© 2014 IEEE.Advances in transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) have revolutionized the way to characterize and quantify transcripts. The breakthroughs in RNA-Seq technologies give rise to the ever-increasing volumes of data, making data processing the bottleneck of transcriptome research. It becomes crucial to develop an efficient analysis pipeline to automate RNA-Seq data analysis. Based on Oshell environment, we present here an ultra-fast and powerful RNA-Seq analysis pipeline for quality control, sequence alignment, variation detection, expression quantification and junction discovery. The pipeline runs on both Linux and Windows operating systems, with either stand-alone or cluster computing environment. Parallel computing is also supported for improved processing speed. Oshell is free for non-commercial use at http://omicsoft.com/oshell.",
