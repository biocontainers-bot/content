The VARI-merge branch includes all of VARI | Cosmo is a fast, low-memory DNA assembler that uses a succinct de Bruijn graph | VARI is an extension to Cosmo and supports offline construction of succinct colored de Bruijn graphs. It can be found in the VARi branch, however all the components are also in this branch. You should use this branch for the VARI tools because it includes an important bugfix: Palendromes are not duplicated during the revcomp generation phase of succinct de Bruijn graph construction",
