The database contains 1771 protein chains from 1670 protein structures and 6182 protein chains from 5425 protein structures in 25 and 90% non-redundant protein chains, respectively. The current version provides information about the α-helical segments and β-strand fragments of varying lengths. In addition, it also contains the information about 310-helix, β- and v-turns and hairpin loops. The free graphics program RASMOL has been interfaced with the search engine to visualize the three-dimensional structures of the user queried secondary structural fragment. The database is updated regularly and is available through Bioinformatics web server at http://cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in/ssep/ or http://144.16.71.148/ssep/.",
