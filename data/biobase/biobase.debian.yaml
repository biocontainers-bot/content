summary: base functions for Bioconductor
description: >
  Biobase is part of the Bioconductor project, and is used by many other
  packages. Biobase contains standardized data structures to represent genomic
  data, and functions that are needed by many other packages or which replace R
  functions.
  .
  Bioconductor is a project to develop innovative software tools for use in
  computational biology. It is based on the R language. You should already be
  quite familiar with R before using Bioconductor. Bioconductor packages provide
  flexible interactive tools for carrying out a number of different computational
  tasks.
