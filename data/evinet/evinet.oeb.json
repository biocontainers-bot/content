The new web resource EviNet provides an easily run interface to network enrichment analysis for exploration of novel, experimentally defined gene sets. The major advantages of this analysis are (i) applicability to any genes found in the global network rather than only to those with pathway/ontology term annotations, (ii) ability to connect genes via different molecular mechanisms rather than within one high-throughput platform, and (iii) statistical power sufficient to detect enrichment of very small sets, down to individual genes. The users' gene sets are either defined prior to upload or derived interactively from an uploaded file by differential expression criteria. The pathways and networks used in the analysis can be chosen from the collection menu. The calculation is typically done within seconds or minutes and the stable URL is provided immediately. The results are presented in both visual (network graphs) and tabular formats using jQuery libraries. Uploaded data and analysis results are kept in separated project directories not accessible by other users. EviNet is available at https://www.evinet.org/.",
