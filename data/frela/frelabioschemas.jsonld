  "sc:description": "Frela is a web service for computing functional relationships of protein pairs based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. It allows very fast calculation of protein functional similarity based on their GO annotations for biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and cellular component (CC) ontologies using various popular semantic similarity measures that can be combined arbitrarily with a set of widely used mixing strategies.",
