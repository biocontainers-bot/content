description: In recent years a wealth of biological data has become available in public
  data repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources and firm integration
  with data analysis is needed for comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis. biomaRt
  provides an interface to a growing collection of databases implementing the BioMart
  software suite (<http://www.biomart.org>). The package enables retrieval of large
  amounts of data in a uniform way without the need to know the underlying database
  schemas or write complex SQL queries. The most prominent examples of BioMart databases
  are maintain by Ensembl, which provides biomaRt users direct access to a diverse
  set of data and enables a wide range of powerful online queries from gene annotation
  to database mining.
