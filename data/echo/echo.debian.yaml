summary: error correction algorithm designed for short-reads from NGS
description: >
  ECHO is an error correction algorithm designed for short-reads
  from next-generation sequencing platforms such as Illumina's
  Genome Analyzer II. The algorithm uses a Bayesian framework to
  improve the quality of the reads in a given data set by employing
  maximum a posteriori estimation.
