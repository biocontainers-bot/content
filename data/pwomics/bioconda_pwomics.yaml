description: pwOmics performs pathway-based level-specific data comparison of matching
  omics data sets based on pre-analysed user-specified lists of differential genes/transcripts
  and phosphoproteins. A separate downstream analysis of phosphoproteomic data including
  pathway identification, transcription factor identification and target gene identification
  is opposed to the upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information
  as basis for identification of upstream transcription factors and potential proteomic
  regulators. The cross-platform comparative analysis allows for comprehensive analysis
  of single time point experiments and time-series experiments by providing static
  and dynamic analysis tools for data integration. In addition, it provides functions
  to identify individual signaling axes based on data integration.
