However, none of them, to our knowledge, wholly implements the PROSITE syntax, or satisfies all the rules for scanning a pattern against a sequence. We hereby propose a strict definition of how a PROSITE pattern is to be scanned against a sequence, and provide a reference implementation of a tool to scan PROSITE patterns, rules and profiles against protein sequences.",
