We have developed a web application that visualizes complex omics data of multiple layers simultaneously, including transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, onto an integrated pathway diagram derived by connecting the individual KEGG pathway maps; the mapped images are generated in Scalable Vector Graphics for easy editing by hand or with computer programs or drawing software. The web application is available at http://megu.iab.keio.ac.jp/. Â© 2006 IOS Press. All rights reserved.",
