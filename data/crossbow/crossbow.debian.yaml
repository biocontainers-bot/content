summary: Genotyping from short reads using cloud computing
description: >
  Crossbow is a scalable software pipeline for whole genome resequencing
  analysis. It combines Bowtie, an ultrafast and memory efficient short read
  aligner, and SoapSNP, an accurate genotyper, within Hadoop to distribute and
  accelerate the computation with many nodes. The pipeline can accurately analyze
  over 35x coverage of a human genome in one day on a 10-node local cluster, or
  in 3 hours for about $100 using a 40-node, 320-core cluster rented from
  Amazon's EC2 utility computing service.
