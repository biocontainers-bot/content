biotools_id: consensusseeker
description: This package compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from multiple
  experiments to extract common regions. The size of the analyzed region is adjustable
  as well as the number of experiences in which a feature must be present in a potential
  region to tag this region as a consensus region.
