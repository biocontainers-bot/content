            "abstract": "Background: One of the most overlooked, yet critical, components of a whole genome sequencing (WGS) project is the submission and curation of the data to a genomic repository, most commonly the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). While large genome centers or genome groups have developed software tools for post-annotation assembly filtering, annotation, and conversion into the NCBI's annotation table format, these tools typically require back-end setup and connection to an Structured Query Language (SQL) database and/or some knowledge of programming (Perl, Python) to implement. With WGS becoming commonplace, genome sequencing projects are moving away from the genome centers and into the ecology or biology lab, where fewer resources are present to support the process of genome assembly curation. To fill this gap, we developed software to assess, filter, and transfer annotation and convert a draft genome assembly and annotation set into the NCBI annotation table (.tbl) format, facilitating submission to the NCBI Genome Assembly database. This software has no dependencies, is compatible across platforms, and utilizes a simple command to perform a variety of simple and complex post-analysis, pre-NCBI submission WGS project tasks. Findings: The Genome Annotation Generator is a consistent and user-friendly bioinformatics tool that can be used to generate a .tbl file that is consistent with the NCBI submission pipeline. Conclusions: The Genome Annotation Generator achieves the goal of providing a publicly available tool that will facilitate the submission of annotated genome assemblies to the NCBI. It is useful for any individual researcher or research group that wishes to submit a genome assembly of their study system to the NCBI.",
