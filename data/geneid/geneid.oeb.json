In the first step, splice sites, start and stop codons are predicted and scored along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays (PWAs). In the second step, exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as the sum of the scores of the defining sites, plus the the log-likelihood ratio of a Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. geneid offers some type of support to integrate predictions from multiple source via external gff files and the redefinition of the general gene structure or model is also feasible. The accuracy of geneid compares favorably to that of other existing tools, but geneid is likely more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.",

These sequences can be partially annotated, and geneid can be used to refine this initial annotation. Training geneid is relatively easy, and parameter configurations exist for a number of eukaryotic species. Geneid produces output in a variety of standard formats. The results, thus, can be processed by a variety of software tools, including visualization programs. Geneid software is in the public domain, and it is undergoing constant development. It is easy to install and use. Exhaustive benchmark evaluations show that geneid compares favorably with other existing gene finding tools.",

In this paper we describe the obtention of PWMs for sites, and the Markov model of coding DNA in Drosophila melanogaster. We also compare other model. Finally, we present and discuss the results obtained when GeneID is used to predict genes in the Adh region. These results show that the accuracy of GeneID predictions compares currently with that of other existing tools but that GeneID is likely to be more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
