summary: GNU R statistical analysis for sparse high-throughput sequencing
description: >
  MetagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational
  Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant
  between two or more groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is
  designed to address the effects of both normalization and under-sampling
  of microbial communities on disease association detection and the
  testing of feature correlations.
