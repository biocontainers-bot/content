summary: Bioinformatics Application for Navigating De novo Assembly Graphs Easily
description: >
  Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly
  graphs made by de novo assemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT and
  others.
  .
  De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but
  also the connections between those contigs, which were previously not
  easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs, with connections,
  using graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent
  contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth.
  Users can interact with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring
  nodes. Sequence information can also be extracted directly from the
  graph viewer. By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage opens
  up new possibilities for analysing and improving de novo assemblies that
  are not possible by looking at contigs alone.
  .
  More information and download links are on the Bandage website:

  The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly and will be
  maintained by the Debian Med team.
version: 0.8.1
