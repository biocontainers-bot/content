  "sc:description": "ProbeSpec is a utility for mapping the specificity of all candidate probes for a given sequence (e.g. transcript) against a background containing a large set of sequences (e.g. a transcriptome). Probe specificity is determined by the subsequence in the background that is most similar to its target, the specificity being set as the number of mismatches between the probe and the closest non-specific background sequence.",
