summary: compute the melting temperature of nucleic acid duplex
description: >
  This program computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy, the
  entropy and the melting temperature of the helix-coil
  transitions. Three types of hybridisation are possible: DNA/DNA,
  DNA/RNA, and RNA/RNA. The program first computes the hybridisation
  enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of each Crick's
  pair by the nearest-neighbor method. Then the melting temperature is
  computed. The set of thermodynamic parameters can be easily changed,
  for instance following an experimental breakthrough.
