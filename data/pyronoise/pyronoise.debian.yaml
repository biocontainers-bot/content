summary: removal of noise from 454 sequenced PCR amplicons
description: >
  AmpliconNoise is a package of applications to clean up high-throughput
  sequence data.  It consists of three main parts:
  .
  Pyronoise - does flowgram-based clustering to spot misreads
  SeqNoise - removes PCR point mutations
  Perseus - removes PCR chimeras without the need for a set of reference
  sequences
  .
  Previously there was a standalone "Pyronoise" by the same authors and
  this package includes an updated version.  There is also a "Denoiser"
  in Qiime which is related but distinct.
