Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has showed a great potential for untargeted lipidomic analysis. Coupling with liquid chromatography and data-independent tandem MS techniques, acquired IM-MS data set contains four-dimensional information for lipid identification, including m/z of MS1 ion, retention time (RT), collision cross section (CCS), and MS/MS spectra. In this protocol, we introduced a data processing workflow using an integrative web server, namely, LipidIMMS Analyzer, to support accurate lipid identification. The protocol demonstrated the integration of all four dimensional information to achieve unambiguous identifications of lipids in complex biological samples.",
