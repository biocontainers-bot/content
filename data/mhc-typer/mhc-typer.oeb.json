            "abstract": "Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdDuplicated loci, for example those associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, often have similar DNA sequences that can be coamplified with a pair of primers. This results in genotyping difficulties and inaccurate analyses. Here, we present a method to assign alleles to different loci in amplifications of duplicated loci. This method simultaneously considers several factors that may each affect correct allele assignment. These are the sharing of identical alleles among loci, null alleles, copy number variation, negative amplification, heterozygote excess or heterozygote deficiency, and linkage disequilibrium. The possible multilocus genotypes are extracted from the alleles for each individual and weighted to estimate the allele frequencies. The likelihood of an allele configuration is calculated and is optimized with a heuristic algorithm. Monte-Carlo simulations and three empirical MHC data sets are used as examples to evaluate the efficacy of our method under different conditions.
