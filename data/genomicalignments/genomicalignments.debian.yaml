summary: BioConductor representation and manipulation of short genomic alignments
description: >
  This BioConductor package provides efficient containers for storing and
  manipulating short genomic alignments (typically obtained by aligning
  short reads to a reference genome). This includes read counting,
  computing the coverage, junction detection, and working with the
  nucleotide content of the alignments.
