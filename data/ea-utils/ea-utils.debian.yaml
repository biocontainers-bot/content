summary: command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data
description: >
  Ea-utils provides a set of command-line tools for processing biological
  sequencing data, barcode demultiplexing, adapter trimming, etc.
  .
  Primarily written to support an Illumina based pipeline - but should work with
  any FASTQs.
  .
  Main Tools are:
  .
   * fastq-mcf
  Scans a sequence file for adapters, and, based on a log-scaled threshold,
  determines a set of clipping parameters and performs clipping. Also does
  skewing detection and quality filtering.
   * fastq-multx
  Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable of auto-determining barcode id's based on a
  master set fields. Keeps multiple reads in-sync during demultiplexing. Can
  verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and fail if they're not.
   * fastq-join
  Similar to audy's stitch program, but in C, more efficient and supports some
  automatic benchmarking and tuning. It uses the same "squared distance for
  anchored alignment" as other tools.
   * varcall
  Takes a pileup and calculates variants in a more easily parameterized manner
  than some other tools.
