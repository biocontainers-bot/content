We have developed a new open-source tool—Fodis—for the analysis of the force-distance curves obtained in single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments, providing almost automatic processing, analysis, and classification of the obtained data. Our method provides also a classification of the possible unfolding pathways and the structural heterogeneity present during the unfolding of proteins.",
