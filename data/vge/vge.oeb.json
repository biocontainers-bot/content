VGE employs master-worker model. It first reserves processors and/or cores by running the job which is parallelized by MPI, then asign divided small tasks onto its worker processes. VGE is written in python.\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Satoshi ITO, Masaaki YADOME, and Satoru MIYANO.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Virtual Grid Engine'",
