  The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational methods
  routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard CPAN-style,
  well-documented, and freely available Perl modules. It is well-accepted
  throughout the community and used in many high-profile projects, e.g.,
  Ensembl.
