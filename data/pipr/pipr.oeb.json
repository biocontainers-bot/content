To address this problem, extensive research efforts have been made to extract predefined features from the sequences. Based on these features, statistical algorithms are learned to classify the PPIs. However, such explicit features are usually costly to extract, and typically have limited coverage on the PPI information. RESULTS:We present an end-to-end framework, PIPR (Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Based on Siamese Residual RCNN), for PPI predictions using only the protein sequences",
