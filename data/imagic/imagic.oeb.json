The system is highly user-oriented, making simple as well as very complicated image analysis procedures available to users with no previous computer experience. Efficient organization of image files, Input/Output operations and of program structure make the system intrinsically fast. Certain problems are solved up to three times faster than in comparable systems. The software package, written in FORTRAN 77, has been applied in the field of high resolution biological electron microscopy mainly. Advanced techniques for analysis of images of single particles, including pattern recognition, are available in IMAGIC. Â© 1981.",
