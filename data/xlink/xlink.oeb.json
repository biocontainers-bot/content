            "abstract": "Distance constraints in proteins and protein complexes provide invaluable information for calculation of 3D structures, identification of protein binding partners and localization of protein-protein contact sites. We have developed an integrative approach to identify and characterize such sites through the analysis of proteolytic products derived from proteins chemically cross-linked by isotopically coded cross-linkers using LC-MALDI tandem mass spectrometry and computer software. This method is specifically tailored toward the rapid analysis of low microgram amounts of proteins or multimeric protein complexes cross-linked with nonlabeled and deuterium-labeled bis-NHS ester cross-linking reagents (both commercially available and readily synthesized). Through labeling with [18O]water solvent and LC-MALDI analysis, the method further allows the possible distinction between Type O and Type 1 or Type 2 modified peptides (monolinks and looplinks or cross-links), although such a distinction is more readily made from analysis of tandem mass spectrometry data. When applied to the bacterial Colicin E7 DNAse/lm7 heterodimeric protein complex, 23 cross-links were identified including six intersubunit cross-links, all between residues that are close in space when examined in the context of the X-ray structure of the heterodimer. In addition, cross-links were successfully identified in five single subunit proteins, beta-lactoglobulin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, myoglobin, and ribonuclease A, establishing the generality of the approach.
