description: This package builds on the Epimods framework which facilitates finding
  weighted subnetworks ("modules") on Illumina Infinium 27k arrays using the SpinGlass
  algorithm, as implemented in the iGraph package. We have created a class of gene
  centric annotations associated with p-values and effect sizes and scores from any
  researchers prior statistical results to find functional modules.
