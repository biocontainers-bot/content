For each MIP entry, this database contains information about the source, gene structure, sequence features, substitutions in the conserved NPA motifs, structural model, the residues forming the selectivity filter and channel radius profile. Users can derive structure-based sequence alignment for sets of MIPs. Sequences and structures of MIPs can be downloaded.",
