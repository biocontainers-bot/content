            "abstract": "Motivation: DiProGB is an easy to use new genome browser that encodes the primary nucleotide sequence by thermodynamical and geometrical dinucleotide properties. The nucleotide sequence is thus converted into a sequence graph. This visualization, supported by different graph manipulation options, facilitates genome analyses, because the human brain can process visual information better than textual information. Also, DiProGB can identify genomic regions where certain physical properties are more conserved than the nucleotide sequence itself. Most of the DiProGB tools can be applied to both, the primary nucleotide sequence and the sequence graph. They include motif and repeat searches as well as statistical analyses. DiProGB adds a new dimension to the common genome analysis approaches by taking into account the physical properties of DNA and RNA. © 2009 The Author(s).",
