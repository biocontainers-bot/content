summary: spliced and SNP-tolerant alignment for mRNA and short reads
description: >
  This package contains the programs GMAP and GSNAP as well as
  utilities to manage genome databases in GMAP/GSNAP format.
  GMAP (Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program) is a tool for aligning
  EST, mRNA and cDNA sequences.
  GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program) is a tool for
  aligning single-end and paired-end transcriptome reads.
  Both tools can use a database of
   * known splice sites and identify novel splice sites.
   * known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
  GSNAP can align bisulfite-treated DNA.
