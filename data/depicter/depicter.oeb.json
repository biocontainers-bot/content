            "abstract": "Â© 2019 Elsevier LtdComputational predictions of the intrinsic disorder and its functions are instrumental to facilitate annotation for the millions of unannotated proteins. However, access to these predictors is fragmented and requires substantial effort to find them and to collect and combine their results. The DEPICTER (DisorderEd PredictIon CenTER) server provides first-of-its-kind centralized access to 10 popular disorder and disorder function predictions that cover protein and nucleic acids binding, linkers, and moonlighting regions. It automates the prediction process, runs user-selected methods on the server side, visualizes the results, and outputs all predictions in a consistent and easy-to-parse format. DEPICTER also includes two accurate consensus predictors of disorder and disordered protein binding. Empirical tests on an independent (low similarity) benchmark dataset reveal that the computational tools included in DEPICTER generate accurate predictions that are significantly better than the results secured using sequence alignment. The DEPICTER server is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DEPICTER/.",
