Large data sets encompassing genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, epigenomes, and other “-omes” that have been generated in the past decade may be easily accessed with such tools, such that hypotheses may be generated at the click of a mouse. In this chapter, we’ll cover the use of bioinformatic tools available at the Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant Biology at http://bar.utoronto.ca for exploring gene expression and coexpression patterns, undertaking promoter analyses, performing functional classification enrichment analyses for sets of genes, and examining protein-protein interactions. We also touch on some newer bioinformatic tools that allow integration of data from several sources for improved hypothesis generation, both for Arabidopsis and translationally. Most of the data sets come from Arabidopsis, but useful BAR tools for other species will be mentioned where appropriate.",

We have developed an easy-to-use online tool for defining a desired expression profile (a modification of our Expression Angler program), which can then be used to identify genes exhibiting patterns of expression that match this profile as closely as possible. Further, we have developed another online tool, Cistome, for predicting or exploring cis-elements in the promoters of sets of co-expressed genes identified by such a method, or by other methods. We present two use cases for these tools, which are freely available on the Bio-Analytic Resource at http://BAR.utoronto.ca.",
