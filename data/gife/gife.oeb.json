        "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MDE' | Efficient and Robust Group-wise Isometric Fiber Embedding | Tractography is a prevalent technique for in vivo imaging of the white matter fibers (a.k.a. the tractograms), but it is also known to be error-prone. We previously propose the Group-wise Tractogram Analysis (GiTA) framework for identifying anatomically valid fibers across subjects according to cross-subject consistency. However, the original framework is based on computationally expensive brute-force KNN search. In this work, we propose a more general and efficient extension of GiTA. Our main idea is to find the finite dimensional vector-space representation of the fiber tracts of varied lengths across different subjects, and we call it the group-wise isometric fiber embedding (GIFE)",
