            "abstract": "© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: By using a class of large modular enzymes known as Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPS), bacteria and fungi are capable of synthesizing a large variety of secondary metabolites, many of which are bioactive and have potential, pharmaceutical applications as e.g. antibiotics. There is thus an interest in predicting the compound synthesized by an NRPS from its primary structure (amino acid sequence) alone, as this would enable an in silico search of whole genomes for NRPS enzymes capable of synthesizing potentially useful compounds. Results: NRPS synthesis happens in a conveyor belt-like fashion where each individual NRPS module is responsible for incorporating a specific substrate (typically an amino acid) into the final product. Here, we present a new method for predicting substrate specificities of individual NRPS modules based on occurrences of motifs in their primary structures. We compare our classifier with existing methods and discuss possible biological explanations of how the motifs might relate to substrate specificity.",
