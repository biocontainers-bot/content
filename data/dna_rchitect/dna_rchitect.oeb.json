        "description": "An R based visualizer for network analysis of chromatin interaction data | A Shiny App for visualizing genomic data | Welcome to the github repository for DNA Rchitect, a Shiny App for visualizing genomic data | DNA Rchitect is a Shiny App for visualizing genomic data (HiC, mRNA, ChIP, ATAC etc) in bed, bedgraph, and bedpe formats. HiC (bedpe format) data is visualized with both bezier curves coupled with network statistics and graphs (using an R port of igraph). Shiny Apps are interactive web applications built with R using the shiny R package. Shiny apps are built with R wrappers for HTML, CSS, and JS to run R code in a web browser through a dynamic and reactive user interface that is powered by an underlying NodeJS engine. These apps can be locally hosted from an R session or hosted in the cloud through a ShinyServer",
