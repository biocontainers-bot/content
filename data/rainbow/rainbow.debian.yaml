summary: clustering and assembling short reads for bioinformatics
description: >
  Efficient tool for clustering and assembling short reads,
  especially for RAD.
  .
  Rainbow is developed to provide an ultra-fast and memory-efficient
  solution to clustering and assembling short reads produced by RAD-seq.
  First, Rainbow clusters reads using a spaced seed method. Then, Rainbow
  implements a heterozygote calling like strategy to divide potential
  groups into haplotypes in a top-down manner. long a guided tree, it
  iteratively merges sibling leaves in a bottom-up manner if they are
  similar enough. Here, the similarity is defined by comparing the 2nd
  reads of a RAD segment. This approach tries to collapse heterozygote
  while discriminate repetitive sequences. At last, Rainbow uses a greedy
  algorithm to locally assemble merged reads into contigs. Rainbow not
  only outputs the optimal but also suboptimal assembly results. Based on
  simulation and a real guppy RAD-seq data, it is shown that Rainbow is
  more competent than the other tools in dealing with RAD-seq data.
