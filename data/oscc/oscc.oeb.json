Methods: Four datasets including expression profiling and relative clinical follow-up data were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. The web server was developed by R software. Results: The web server was named OScc including 690 patients and can be accessed at http://bioinfo.henu.edu.cn/CESC/CESCList.jsp. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank p-value and hazard ratio will be generated of interested gene in OScc. Compared with previous predictive tools, OScc had the advantages of registration-free, larger sample size and subgroup analysis. Conclusion: The OScc is highly valuable to perform the preliminary assessment and validation of new or interested prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer.",
