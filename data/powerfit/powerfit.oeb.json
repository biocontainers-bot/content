            "abstract": "© 2015, Alexandre M.J.J. Bonvin, et al. Cryo-EM is a rapidly developing method to investigate the three dimensional structure of large macromolecular complexes. In spite of all the advances in the field, the resolution of most cryo-EM density maps is too low for de novo model building. Therefore, the data are often complemented by fitting high-resolution subunits in the density to allow for an atomic interpretation. Typically, the first step in the modeling process is placing the subunits in the density as a rigid body. An objective method for automatic placement is full-exhaustive six dimensional cross correlation search between the model and the cryo-EM data, where the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom are systematically sampled. In this article we present PowerFit, a Python package and program for fast and sensitive rigid body fitting. We introduce a novel, more sensitive scoring function, the core-weighted local cross correlation, and show how it can be calculated using FFTs for fast translational cross correlation scans. We further improved the search algorithm by using optimized rotational sets to reduce rotational redundancy and by limiting the cryo-EM data size through resampling and trimming the density. We demonstrate the superior scoring sensitivity of our scoring function on simulated data of the 80S D. melanogaster ribosome and on experimental data for four different cases. Through these advances, a fine-grained rotational search can now be performed within minutes on a CPU and seconds on a GPU. PowerFit is free software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s) Structure determination of complex molecular machines requires a combination of an increasing number of experimental methods with highly specialized software geared toward each data source to properly handle the gathered data. Recently, we introduced the two software packages PowerFit and DisVis. These combine high-resolution structures of atomic subunits with density maps from cryo-electron microscopy or distance restraints, typically acquired by chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry, respectively. Here, we report on recent advances in both GPGPU-accelerated software packages: PowerFit is a tool for rigid body fitting of atomic structures in cryo-electron density maps and has been updated to also output reliability indicators for the success of fitting, through the use of the Fisher z-transformation and associated confidence intervals; DisVis aims at quantifying the information content of distance restraints and identifying false-positive restraints. We extended its analysis capabilities to include an analysis of putative interface residues and to output an average shape representing the putative location of the ligand. To facilitate their use by a broad community, they have been implemented as web portals harvesting both local CPU resources and GPGPU-accelerated EGI grid resources. They offer user-friendly interfaces, while minimizing computational requirements, and provide a first interactive view of the results. The portals can be accessed freely after registration via http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS and http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/POWERFIT.",
