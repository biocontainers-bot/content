The entire spectrum of available experimental data, including the data of DNAse footprinting, SELEX, ChIP-chip, and B1H-system, has been used. Motifs constructed by integrating the data obtained by independent experimental methods show the highest sensitivity. The collection of motifs can be used to refine the immediate binding sites of transcription factors in DNA nucleotide sequences. The collection of motifs and the results of the estimation of motif quality are available at: http://line.imb.ac.ru/iDMMPMM. The realization of the algorithm ChIPmunk is accessible at http://line.imb.ac.ru/Chipmunk.",
