The Rfam database is a collection of RNA families in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment, a consensus secondary structure, and a covariance model. In this paper we introduce Rfam release 13.0, which switches to a new genome-centric approach that annotates a non-redundant set of reference genomes with RNA families. We describe new web interface features including faceted text search and R-scape secondary structure visualizations. We discuss a new literature curation workflow and a pipeline for building families based on RNAcentral. There are 236 new families in release 13.0, bringing the total number of families to 2687. The Rfam website is http://rfam.org.",

In this article, we detail updates and improvements to the Rfam data and website for the Rfam 12.0 release. We describe the upgrade of our search pipeline to use Infernal 1.1 and demonstrate its improved homology detection ability by comparison with the previous version. The new pipeline is easier for users to apply to their own data sets, and we illustrate its ability to annotate RNAs in genomic and metagenomic data sets of various sizes. Rfam has been expanded to include 260 new families, including the well-studied large subunit ribosomal RNA family, and for the first time includes information on short sequence- and structure-based RNA motifs present within families.",
