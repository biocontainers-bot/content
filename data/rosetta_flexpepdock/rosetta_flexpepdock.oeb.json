The Rosetta FlexPepDock web server (http://flexpepdock.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il/) provides an interface to a high-resolution peptide docking (refinement) protocol for the modeling of peptide-protein complexes, implemented within the Rosetta framework. Given a protein receptor structure and an approximate, possibly inaccurate model of the peptide within the receptor binding site, the FlexPepDock server refines the peptide to high resolution, allowing full flexibility to the peptide backbone and to all side chains. This protocol was extensively tested and benchmarked on a wide array of non-redundant peptide-protein complexes, and was proven effective when applied to peptide starting conformations within 5.5 backbone root mean square deviation from the native conformation. FlexPepDock has been applied to several systems that are mediated and regulated by peptide-protein interactions. This easy to use and general web server interface allows non-expert users to accurately model their specific peptide-protein interaction of interest. Â© 2011 The Author(s).",
