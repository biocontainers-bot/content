summary: pair-wise alignment-plots for genomic sequences in PostScript
description: >
  A program to visualize the alignment of two genomic sequences together with
  their annotations. From GFF-format input files it produces PostScript figures
  for that alignment.
  The following menu lists many features of gff2aplot:
   * Comprehensive alignment plots for any GFF-feature. Attributes are defined
     separately so you can modify only whatsoever attributes for a given file or
     share same customization across different data-sets.
   * All parameters are set by default within the program, but it can be also
     fully configured via gff2ps-like flexible customization files. Program can
     handle several of such files, summarizing all the settings before producing
     the corresponding figure. Moreover, all customization parameters can be set
     via command-line switches, which allows users to play with those parameters
     before adding any to a customization file.
   * Source order is taken from input files, if you swap file order you can
     visualize alignment and its annotation with the new input arrangement.
   * All alignment scores can be visualized in a PiP box below gff2aplot area,
     using grey-color scale, user-defined color scale or score-dependent
     gradients.
   * Scalable fonts, which can also be chosen among the basic PostScript default
     fonts. Feature and group labels can be rotated to improve readability in
     both annotation axes.
   * The program is still defined as a Unix filter so it can handle data from
     files, redirections and pipes, writing output to standard-output and
     warnings to standard error.
   * gff2aplot is able to manage many physical page formats (from A0 to A10, and
     more -see available page sizes in its manual-), including user-defined ones.
     This allows, for instance, the generation of poster size genomic maps, or
     the use of a continuous-paper supporting plotting device, either in portrait
     or landscape.
   * You can draw different alignments on same alignment plot and distinguish
     them by using different colors for each.
   * Shape dictionary has been expanded, so that further feature shapes are now
     available (see manual).
   * Annotation projections through alignment plots (so called ribbons) emulate
     transparencies via complementary color fill patterns. This feature allows
     one to show color pseudo-blending when horizontal and vertical ribbons
     overlap.
