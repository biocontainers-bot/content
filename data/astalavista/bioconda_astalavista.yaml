summary: AStalavista is a computer program to extract alternative splicing (AS) events
  from a given genomic annotation of exon-intron gene coordinates. By comparing all
  given transcripts, AStalavista detects the variations in their splicing structure
  and identify all AS events (like exon skipping, alternate donor, etc) by assigning
  to each of them an AS code.
