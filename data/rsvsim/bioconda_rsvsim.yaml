description: RSVSim is a package for the simulation of deletions, insertions, inversion,
  tandem-duplications and translocations of various sizes in any genome available
  as FASTA-file or BSgenome data package. SV breakpoints can be placed uniformly accross
  the whole genome, with a bias towards repeat regions and regions of high homology
  (for hg19) or at user-supplied coordinates.
