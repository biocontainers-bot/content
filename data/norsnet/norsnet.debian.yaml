summary: tool to identify unstructured loops in proteins
description: >
  NORSnet can distinguish between very long contiguous segments with
  non-regular secondary structure (NORS regions) and well-folded proteins.
  .
  NORSnet was trained on predicted information rather than on experimental data.
  This allows NORSnet to reach into regions in sequence space that are not
  covered by specialized disorder predictors.  One disadvantage of this approach
  is that it is not optimal for the identification of the "average" disordered
  region.
  .
  NORSnet takes the following input, further described on norsnet(1):
   * a protein sequence in a FASTA file
   * secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction by prof(1)
   * an HSSP file
   * flexible/rigid residues prediction by profbval(1)
