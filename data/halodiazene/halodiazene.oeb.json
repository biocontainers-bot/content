The data were obtained from <i>ab initio< i> geometric optimization and frequency calculations at HF, B3LYP, MP2 and CCSD levels of theory on 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Input structures were generated by shell scripts and run by Q-Chem quantum chemical package. The output files were processed to extract geometric and energetic information by Wolfram Mathematica.< p>.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Halodiphosphene', 'methylphosphine', 'diazene', 'Halomethylphosphine'",
