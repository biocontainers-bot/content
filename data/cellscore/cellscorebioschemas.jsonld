  "sc:description": "It contains functions to evaluate the cell identity of a test sample, given a cell transition defined with a starting (donor) cell type and a desired target cell type. The evaluation is based upon a scoring system, which uses a set of standard samples of known cell types, as the reference set. The functions have been carried out on a large set of microarray data from one platform.",
