            "abstract": "Interactions between proteins and DNA molecules lie at the core of the fundamental cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation. Some of these interactions have been experimentally described at atomic scale, but the molecular details of many others remain to be discovered. TFmodeller exploits the current knowledge about protein-DNA interfaces contained in the Protein Data Bank and uses it to model similar interfaces related by homology. Results are emailed to the user and include an evolutionary contact matrix, a schematic representation of the putative binding interface and atomic coordinates of the modelled complex. The library of complexes used by TFmodeller is updated on a weekly basis and is available for download. Â© The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
