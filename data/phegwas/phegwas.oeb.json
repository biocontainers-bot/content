The Manhattan plot is the popular way to visualize this( https://github.com/stephenturner/qqman ). On the other hand, PheWAS (https://rdrr.io/github/PheWAS/PheWAS/ ) is phenome wide association study which is done on a single variant and many phenotypes. PheGWAS is a new concept to do analysis on many variants and many phenotypes. This is a package to do interactive 3D visualization on many variants many phenotypes",
