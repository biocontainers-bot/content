Several tools have been developed to quantify niche size and overlap. Nonetheless, methods adapted by spatial ecologists to quantify animal home ranges can be modified for use in stable isotope ecology when data are not normally distributed in bivariate space. We offer a tool that draws on existing spatial metrics, such as Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) and Standard Ellipse Area (SEA), and add novel metrics using Kernel Utilization Density (KUD) estimators to measure isotopic niche size and overlap. We present examples using empirical and simulated data to demonstrate the performance of the package Kernel Isotopic Niches in R (rKIN) under various scenarios.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'niche', 'isotopic'",
