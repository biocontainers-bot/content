        "description": "An Online Package for Evaluation of Complex Detection Methods | Complex Detection Analyzer Package (CADP) helps you to execute protein complex detection methods and compare their results in a quick and compact ways. It computes a wide range of evaluation criteria and visualize the comparison of methods in tables and multiplots. It assists you in filtering detected clusters by providing a protein name (STRING ID) as a query and by setting constraint on maximum and minimum number of proteins in detected clusters. The list of methods for detecting protein complexes is as follows: | You may look for the values of evaluation criteria for a specific threshold. This can also be done by CDAP. The PPI datasets are: | You can also upload the result of any other method for evaluating its results. The valid format for uploaded file is described here | The list of evaluation criteria is as follows:",
