description: This package is an extension to CellNOptR.  It contains additional functionality
  needed to simulate and train a prior knowledge network to experimental data using
  constrained fuzzy logic (cFL, rather than Boolean logic as is the case in CellNOptR).  Additionally,
  this package will contain functions to use for the compilation of multiple optimization
  results (either Boolean or cFL).
