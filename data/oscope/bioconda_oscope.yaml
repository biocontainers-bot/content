description: 'Oscope is a statistical pipeline developed to identifying and recovering
  the base cycle profiles of oscillating genes in an unsynchronized single cell RNA-seq
  experiment. The Oscope pipeline includes three modules: a sine model module to search
  for candidate oscillator pairs; a K-medoids clustering module to cluster candidate
  oscillators into groups; and an extended nearest insertion module to recover the
  base cycle order for each oscillator group.'
