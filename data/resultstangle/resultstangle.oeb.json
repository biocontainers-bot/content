Starting from sequences of MBS-items and timespans, TANGLE can predict which diabetic patient, currently on metformin only, is likely to be prescribed with a different type of diabetes controlling drug in the near future.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:Tangle', 'Tangle'",
