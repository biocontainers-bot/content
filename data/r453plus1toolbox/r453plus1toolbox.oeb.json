Projects generated with Roche's data analysis software can be imported into R allowing advanced and customized analyses within the R/Bioconductor environment for sequencing data. Several methods were implemented extending the current functionality of Roche's software. These extensions include methods for quality assurance and annotation of detected variants. Further, a pipeline for the detection of structural variants, e.g. balanced chromosomal translocations, is provided. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
