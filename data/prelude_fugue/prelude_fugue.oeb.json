Prelude&Fugue computes all lowest free energy conformations of a protein or protein region, ranked by increasing energy, and possibly satisfying some interresidue distance constraints specified by the user. Prelude&Fugue detects sequence regions whose predicted structure is significantly preferred relative to other conformations in the absence of tertiary interactions. These programs can be used for predicting secondary structure, tertiary structure of short peptides, flickering early folding sequences and peptides that adopt a preferred conformation in solution. They can also be used for detecting structural weaknesses, i.e. sequence regions that are not optimal with respect to the tertiary fold. Â© 2006 Oxford University Press.",
