summary: genome annotation viewer and editor
description: >
  Apollo is a genome annotation viewer and editor. It was developed as a
  collaboration between the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (part of
  the FlyBase consortium) and The Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK.
  Apollo allows researchers to explore genomic annotations at many levels
  of detail, and to perform expert annotation curation, all in a graphical
  environment. It was used by the FlyBase biologists to construct the
  Release 3 annotations on the finished Drosophila melanogaster genome,
  and is also a primary vehicle for sharing these annotations with the
  community. The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, which
  aims to provide a complete ready-to-use toolkit for analyzing whole
  genomes, has adopted Apollo as its annotation workbench.
