  "sc:description": "Full-Parasites is a transcriptome database of apicomplexa parasites, which include Plasmodium and Toxoplasma species. It contains EST sequences, full length cDNAs, transcription start sites and RNA-seq data sets. Various types of cDNA data resources were interconnected with our original database functionalities. By providing the largest unique full-length cDNA and dynamic transcriptome data, Full-Parasites is useful for understanding host-parasite interactions.",
