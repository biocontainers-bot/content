However, reads that observe the same non-reference DNA sequence are highly correlated and can be used to better model the true variation in the target genome. A novel short-read micro re-aligner, SRMA, that leverages this correlation to better resolve a consensus of the underlying DNA sequence of the targeted genome is described here.
