Understanding the association between diseases and genes can be enhanced with the identification of involved biological events in this association. Although biological knowledge has been accumulated in several databases and can be accessed through the Web, there is no specialized Web tool yet allowing for a query into the relationship among diseases, genes and biological events. For this task, we developed DigSee to search MEDLINE abstracts for evidence sentences describing that 'genes' are involved in the development of 'cancer' through 'biological events'. DigSee is available through http://gcancer.org/digsee.",
