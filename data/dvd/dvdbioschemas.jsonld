Its purpose is to share all genetic variants detected in the course of next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications between collaborators. It helps medical researchers to distinguish between functionally relevant and benign genetic variants. DVD also allows users to contact the researcher who originally identified a particular genetic mutation.",
