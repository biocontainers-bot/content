  "sc:description": "Mascot Distiller Workstation offers a single, intuitive interface to a wide range of native (binary) mass spectrometry data files. A unique algorithm, which fits each peak to a calculated isotope distribution, processes the raw data into high quality, de-isotoped peak lists. \n\nThis core functionality can be extended by adding one or more toolboxes. These are optional collections of tools for specific tasks, such as Mascot search result review, automatic and manual de novo sequencing, quantitation, and batch processing. There is also a developerâ€™s package that provides access to the API of the underlying COM library.",
