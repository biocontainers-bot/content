VAAL detected âˆ¼98% of differences (including large insertion-deletions) between pairs of strains from three species while calling no false positives. VAAL also pinpointed a single mutation between Vibrio cholerae genomes, identifying an antibiotic's site of action by identifying sequence differences between drug-sensitive strains and drug-resistant derivatives.",
