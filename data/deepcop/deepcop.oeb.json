Combining large genomics and molecular data sources with powerful deep learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize predictive biology. In this study, we present Deep Compound Profiler (DeepCOP), a deep learning based model that can predict gene regulating effects of low-molecular weight compounds. This model can be used for direct identification of a drug candidate causing a desired gene expression response, without utilizing any information on its interactions with protein target(s)",
