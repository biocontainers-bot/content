        "description": "A Sequence-Based Meta-Predictor for Improving the Prediction of Antiviral Peptides Using Effective Feature Representation.\n\nIn spite of the large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses remain a prominent human disease. Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences. Herein, the effective feature representation was extracted from a set of prediction scores derived from various machine learning algorithms and types of features",
