  "sc:description": "It can be used to construct genetic linkage maps and perform functional QTL mapping with molecular markers generated in a full-sib family. For linkage analysis, it utilizes seven segregation types of markers to estimate the recombination and simultaneously predict the linkage phase between any two markers. It takes heuristic search method for ordering large number of markers of a linkage group by incorporating local ordering methods.",
