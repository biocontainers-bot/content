  "sc:description": "It is a gene expression database to provide the transcriptional changes throughout the growth of the rice plant in the field. It contains two data sets corresponding to spatiotemporal gene expression profiles of various organs and tissues, and continuous gene expression profiles of leaf from transplanting to harvesting. Analysis tools facilitate the comparison of expression profiles between two random samples and the prediction of function of uncharacterized genes.",
