Clustering is achieved by fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood, using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Our implementation extends existing methods by allowing for missingness in the input data. The EM algorithm addresses missingness of both the cluster assignments and the vector components. The output includes the marginal cluster membership probabilities; the mean and covariance of each cluster; the density of each mixture component evaluated on the observations; the posterior probabilities of cluster membership; maximum a posteriori cluster assignments; and a completed version of the input data, with missing values replaced by their posterior expectations",
