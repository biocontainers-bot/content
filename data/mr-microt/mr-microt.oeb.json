Computational methods that predict which genes are targeted by particular miRNA molecules are known as target prediction methods. In this paper, we present a MapReduce-based system, termed MR-microT, for one of the most popular and accurate, but computational intensive, prediction methods. MR-microT offers the highly requested by life scientists feature of predicting the targets of ad-hoc miRNA molecules in near-real time through an intuitive Web interface. © Copyright 2014 ACM 978-1-4503-2722-0/14/06⋯$15. 00.",
