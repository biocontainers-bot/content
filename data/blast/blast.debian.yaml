summary: next generation suite of BLAST sequence search tools
description: >
  The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely
  used sequence similarity tool. There are versions of BLAST that
  compare protein queries to protein databases, nucleotide queries
  to nucleotide databases, as well as versions that translate nucleotide
  queries or databases in all six frames and compare to protein databases
  or queries.
  PSI-BLAST produces a position-specific-scoring-matrix (PSSM) starting
  with a protein query, and then uses that PSSM to perform further searches.
  It is also possible to compare a protein or nucleotide query to a
  database of PSSMâ€™s.
  The NCBI supports a BLAST web page at blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as well as
  a network service.
version: 2.9.0
