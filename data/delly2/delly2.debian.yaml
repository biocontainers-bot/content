summary: Structural variant discovery by read analysis
description: >
  Delly performs Structural variant discovery by integrated paired-end and
  split-read analysis. It discovers, genotypes and visualizes deletions,
  tandem duplications, inversions and translocations at single-nucleotide
  resolution in short-read massively parallel sequencing data. It uses
  paired-ends, split-reads and read-depth to sensitively and accurately
  delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome.
