  "sc:description": "DomainParser uses a new algorithm for the decomposition of a multi-domain protein into individual structural domains. The underlying principle used is that residue-residue contacts are denser within a domain than between domains. We have formulated the domain decomposition problem as a network flow problem, in which each residue is represented as a node of a network and each residue-residue contact is represented as an edge with a particular capacity, depending on the type of the contact.",
