summary: rapid ribosomal RNA prediction
description: >
  Barrnap (BAsic Rapid Ribosomal RNA Predictor) predicts the location of
  ribosomal RNA genes in genomes. It supports bacteria (5S,23S,16S), archaea
  (5S,5.8S,23S,16S), mitochondria (12S,16S) and eukaryotes (5S,5.8S,28S,18S).
  .
  It takes FASTA DNA sequence as input, and writes GFF3 as output. It uses the
  NHMMER tool that comes with HMMER 3.1 for HMM searching in RNA:DNA style.
  Multithreading is supported and one can expect roughly linear speed-ups
  with more CPUs.
