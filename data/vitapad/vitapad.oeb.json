Results: VitaPad is a cross-platform application that enables users to create and modify biological pathway diagrams and incorporate microarray data with them. It improves on existing software in the following areas: (i) It can create diagrams dynamically through graph layout algorithms. (ii) It is open-source and uses an open XML format to store data, allowing for easy extension or integration with other tools. (iii) It features a cutting-edge user interface with intuitive controls, high-resolution graphics and fully customizable appearance. Â© The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press.
