Simulation of diffusional association (SDA) is a software for carrying out Brownian dynamics simulations that can be used to study the interactions between two or more biological macromolecules. webSDA allows users to run Brownian dynamics simulations with SDA to study bimolecular association and encounter complex formation, to compute association rate constants, and to investigate macromolecular crowding using atomically detailed macromolecular structures. webSDA facilitates and automates the use of the SDA software, and offers user-friendly visualization of results. web-SDA currently has three modules: 'SDA docking' to generate structures of the diffusional encounter complexes of two macromolecules, 'SDA association' to calculate bimolecular diffusional association rate constants, and 'SDA multiple molecules' to simulate the diffusive motion of hundreds of macromolecules. webSDA is freely available to all users and there is no login requirement. webSDA is available at http://mcm.h-its.org/webSDA/.",

If the atomic structure of the bound complex is known, it can be used to calculate bimolecular association rates. It can also be used to record Brownian dynamics trajectories or encounter complexes and calculate bimolecular electron transfer rate constants.",
