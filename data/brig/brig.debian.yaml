summary: BLAST Ring Image Generator
description: >
  BRIG can display circular comparisons between a large number of genomes,
  with a focus on handling genome assembly data.
   * Images show similarity between a central reference sequence and other
     sequences as concentric rings.
   * BRIG will perform all BLAST comparisons and file parsing automatically
     via a simple GUI.
   * Contig boundaries and read coverage can be displayed for draft genomes;
     customized graphs and annotations can be displayed.
   * Using a user-defined set of genes as input, BRIG can display gene
     presence, absence, truncation or sequence variation in a set of
     complete genomes, draft genomes or even raw, unassembled sequence data.
   * BRIG also accepts SAM-formatted read-mapping files enabling genomic
     regions present in unassembled sequence data from multiple samples to
     be compared simultaneously
