description: Detection of copy number variants (CNV) from exome sequencing samples,
  including unpaired samples.  The package implements a hidden Markov model which
  uses positional covariates, such as background read depth and GC-content, to simultaneously
  normalize and segment the samples into regions of constant copy count.
