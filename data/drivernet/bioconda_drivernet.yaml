biotools_id: drivernet
description: DriverNet is a package to predict functional important driver genes in
  cancer by integrating genome data (mutation and copy number variation data) and
  transcriptome data (gene expression data). The different kinds of data are combined
  by an influence graph, which is a gene-gene interaction network deduced from pathway
  data. A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver genes, which may mutated
  in a larger number of patients and these mutations will push the gene expression
  values of the connected genes to some extreme values.
