            "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2018 American Chemical Society.Routine identification of thousands of proteins in a single LC-MS experiment has long become the norm. With these vast amounts of data, more rigorous treatment of modified forms of peptides becomes possible. \"Open search\", a protein database search with a large precursor ion mass tolerance window, is becoming a popular method to evaluate possible sets of post-translational and chemical modifications in samples. The extraction of statistical information about the modification from peptide search results requires additional effort and data processing, such as recalibration of masses and accurate detection of precursors in MS1 signals. Here we present a software tool, DeltaMass, which performs kernel-density-based estimation of observed mass shifts and allows for the detection of poorly resolved mass deltas. The software also maps observed mass shifts to known modifications from public databases such as UniMod and augments them with additionally generated possible chemical changes to the molecule. Its interactive graphical interface provides an effective option for the visual interrogation of the data and the identification of potentially interesting mass shifts or unusual artifacts for subsequent analysis. However, the program can also be used in fully automated command-line mode to generate mass-shift peak lists as well.",
