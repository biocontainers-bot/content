summary: RNA-Seq driven gene finding incorporating ambiguous reads
description: >
  GIIRA is a gene prediction method that identifies potential coding
  regions exclusively based on the mapping of reads from an RNA-Seq
  experiment.  It was foremost designed for prokaryotic gene prediction
  and is able to resolve genes within the expressed region of an operon.
  However, it is also applicable to eukaryotes and predicts exon intron
  structures as well as alternative isoforms.
