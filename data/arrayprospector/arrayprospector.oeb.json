However, most methods for predicting functional associations between genes from expression data are not suited to simultaneous analysis of multiple datasets, and a comprehensive resource of coexpression-based predictions is currently lacking. Here, we present an interactive web resource of gene associations predicted by applying a novel algorithm to all expression data in the Stanford Microarray Database. The underlying pre-computed database currently contains more than 200 000 high-confidence gene associations in 12 different species sampled from a broad taxonomic range. The resource allows every association to be inspected visually and can be accessed at http://www.bork.embl.de/ArrayProspector. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
