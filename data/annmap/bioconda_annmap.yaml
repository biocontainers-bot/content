description: annmap provides annotation mappings for Affymetrix exon arrays and coordinate
  based queries to support deep sequencing data analysis. Database access is hidden
  behind the API which provides a set of functions such as genesInRange(), geneToExon(),
  exonDetails(), etc. Functions to plot gene architecture and BAM file data are also
  provided. Underlying data are from Ensembl.
