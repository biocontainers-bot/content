However, modelling the combinatorial landscape of stresses experienced by diseased cells is challenging, leaving functional relationships within the global stress response network incompletely understood. Here, we leverage genome-scale fitness screening data from 625 cancer cell lines, each representing a unique biological context, to build a network of “coessential” gene relationships centered around master regulators of the response to proteotoxic, oxidative, hypoxic, and genotoxic stress.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'coessential', 'proteotoxic', 'HAPSTR', 'C16orf72'",
