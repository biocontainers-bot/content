Sophisticated modeling software is required to fit data to such models and to make predictions using these compartmental models. WinSAAM is one such modeling program. The purpose the current report is to describe the features of WinSAAM that make this program suited for modeling all manner of biological systems. We highlight new features, especially those that are unique to WinSAAM, and illustrate with examples how WinSAAM is used to construct models of metabolic systems, to simulate the effects of experiments on systems, and to fit models to data.
