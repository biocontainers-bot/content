Using BioTapestry, a researcher can-construct a network model and use it to visualize and understand the dynamic behavior of a complex, spatially and temporally distributed GRN. Here we provide a step-by-step example of a way to use BioTapestry to build a GRN model and discuss some common issues that can arise during this process.
