summary: genetic mapping considering population structure
description: >
  EMMAX is a statistical test for large scale human or model organism
  association mapping accounting for the sample structure. In addition
  to the computational efficiency obtained by EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes
  advantage of the fact that each locus explains only a small fraction of
  complex traits, which allows one to avoid repetitive variance component
  estimation procedure, resulting in a significant amount of increase in
  computational time of association mapping using mixed model.
