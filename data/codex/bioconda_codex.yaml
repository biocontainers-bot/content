description: A normalization and copy number variation calling procedure for whole
  exome DNA sequencing data. CODEX relies on the availability of multiple samples
  processed using the same sequencing pipeline for normalization, and does not require
  matched controls. The normalization model in CODEX includes terms that specifically
  remove biases due to GC content, exon length and targeting and amplification efficiency,
  and latent systemic artifacts. CODEX also includes a Poisson likelihood-based recursive
  segmentation procedure that explicitly models the count-based exome sequencing data.
