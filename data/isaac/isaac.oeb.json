We demonstrate that our combined pipeline (Isaac) is four to five times faster than BWA + GATK on equivalent hardware, with comparable accuracy as measured by trio conflict rates and sensitivity. We further show that Isaac is effective in the detection of disease-causing variants and can easily/economically be run on commodity hardware.Availability: Isaac has an open source license and can be obtained at https://github.com/ sequencing.Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
