These studies seek to collect passive and active sensor signals from participants' smartphones for the purposes of modelling and predicting health outcomes, with a specific focus on mental health. We also highlight features of the current research landscape that recommend the coordinated development of such platforms, including the significant technical and resource costs of development, and we identify specific considerations relevant to the design of platforms for digital phenotyping.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Intelligent Sensing Inform Learn'",
