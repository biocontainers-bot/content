Despite its availability and widespread use over the years, some details about its implementation have not been previously disseminated or are not well understood. We address a few of these details in depth and highlight new features available in the latest release. Comet is freely available for download at http://comet-ms.sourceforge.net or it can be accessed as a component of a number of larger software projects into which it has been incorporated.
