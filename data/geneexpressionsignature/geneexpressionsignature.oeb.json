GeneExpressionSignature is an R package developed for the large-scale analysis of gene expression signatures. The package implements two rank-merging algorithms and two similarity-scoring algorithms. The functions of GeneExpressionSignature provide a flexible solution for gene expression signature-based studies and hold great potential in biomedical research applications, such as drug repurposing.

Gene expression signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. Its distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs, diseases, and biological states of interest.",
