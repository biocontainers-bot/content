            "abstract": "Computer programs for the statistical analysis of microsatellite data use allele length variation to infer, e.g. population genetic parameters, to detect quantitative trait loci or selective sweeps. However, observed allele lengths are usually inaccurate and may deviate from the expected periodicity of repeats. The common practice of rounding to the nearest whole number frequently results in miscalls and underestimations of allelic richness. Manual sorting of allele lengths into discrete classes, a process called binning, is tedious and error-prone. Here, we present a new program for the automated binning of microsatellite allele lengths to overcome these problems and to facilitate high-throughput allele binning. Â© The Author 2009.

        "description": "All microsatellite analysis software expects allele sizes given in integer numbers, while allele scoring produces allele sizes with two decimals that are dependent not only on fragment length, but also on fluorescent dye, and GC content. Therefore, allele binning is not a trivial task. This tool fills a gap of the microsatellite workflow by rounding allele sizes to valid integers, depending on the microsatellite repeat units.",
