summary: Multiple alignment program of protein sequences
description: >
  MUSCLE is a multiple alignment program for protein sequences. MUSCLE
  stands for multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation. In the
  authors tests, MUSCLE achieved the highest scores of all tested
  programs on several alignment accuracy benchmarks, and is also one of
  the fastest programs out there.
