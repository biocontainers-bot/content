        "description": "automatic preparation of annotated DNA sequences for bulk submissions to ENA.\n\nABSTRACT Motivation The submission of annotated sequence data to public sequence databases constitutes a central pillar in biological research. The surge of novel DNA sequences awaiting database submission due to the application of next-generation sequencing has increased the need for software tools that facilitate bulk submissions. This need has yet to be met with a concurrent development of tools to automate the preparatory work preceding such submissions. Results I introduce annonex2embl , a Python package that automates the preparation of complete sequence flatfiles for large-scale sequence submissions to the European Nucleotide Archive. The tool enables the conversion of DNA sequence alignments that are co-supplied with sequence annotations and metadata to submission-ready flatfiles.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
