summary: count k-mers in DNA sequences
description: >
  JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in
  DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences
  of all such substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA
  sequence. JELLYFISH can count k-mers using an order of magnitude less
  memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting
  packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by
  exploiting the "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase
  parallelism.
  .
  JELLYFISH is a command-line program that reads FASTA and multi-FASTA
  files containing DNA sequences. It outputs its k-mer counts in an
  binary format, which can be translated into a human-readable text
  format using the "jellyfish dump" command.
  .
  This is the latest version of the 1.x series of jellyfish which is
  used by some other applications that are not compatible with version
  2.x which is provided inside the jellyfish package.
version: 1.1.11
