            "abstract": "Contact surface area and chemical properties of atoms are used to concurrently predict conformations of multiple amino acid side chains on a fixed protein backbone. The combination of surface complementarity and solvent-accessible surface accounts for van der Waals forces and solvation free energy. The scoring function is particularly suitable for modeling partially buried side chains. Both iterative and stochastic searching approaches are used. Our programs (Sccomp-I and Sccomp-S), with relatively fast execution times, correctly predict x1 angles for 92-93% of buried residues and 82-84% for all residues, with an RMSD of ∼1.7 Å for side chain heavy atoms. We find that the differential between the atomic solvation parameters and the contact surface parameters (including those between noncomplementary atoms) is positive; i.e., most protein atoms prefer surface contact with other protein atoms rather than with the solvent. This might correspond to the driving force for maximizing packing of the protein. The influence of the crystal packing, completeness of rotamer library and precise positioning of Cβ atoms on the accuracy of side-chain prediction are examined. The Sccomp-S and Sccomp-I programs can be accessed through the Web (http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/ sccomp.html) and are available for several platforms. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Results: Tools are described for the analysis of ligand-protein contacts (LPC software) and contacts of structural units (CSU software) such as helices, sheets, strands and residues. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of interatomic contacts and interface complementarity. For any ligand or structural unit, these software automatically: (i) calculate the solvent-accessible surface of every atom; (ii) determine the contacting residues and type of interaction they undergo (hydrophobic-hydrophobic, aromatic-aromatic, etc.); (iii) indicate all putative hydrogen bonds. LPC software further predicts changes in binding strength following chemical modification of the ligand. Availability: Both LPC and CSU can be accessed through the PDB and are integrated in the 3DB Atlas page of all PDB files. Finally, LPC and CSU can be accessed at: http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/lpc and http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/csu.",

            "abstract": "A method is described to dock a ligand into a binding site in a protein on the basis of the complementarity of the intermolecular atomic contacts. Docking is performed by maximization of a complementarity function that is dependent on atomic contact surface area and the chemical properties of the contacting atoms. The generality and simplicity of the complementarity function ensure that a wide range of chemical structures can be handled. The ligand and the protein are treated as rigid bodies, but displacement of a small number of residues lining the ligand binding site can be taken into account. The method can assist in the design of improved ligands by indicating what changes in complementarity may occur as a result of the substitution of an atom in the ligand. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by application to 14 protein-ligand complexes of known crystal structure.",
