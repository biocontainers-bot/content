summary: genomics application for assembling millions of very short DNA sequences
description: >
  The Short Sequence Assembly by K-mer search and 3′ read Extension
  (SSAKE) is a genomics application for aggressively assembling
  millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching for
  perfect 3′-most k-mers using a DNA prefix tree. SSAKE is designed to
  help leverage the information from short sequences reads by
  stringently clustering them into contigs that can be used to
  characterize novel sequencing targets.
