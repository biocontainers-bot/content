When applied to the entire Protein Data Bank, 164 »514 druggable cavities were identified and classified in four groups (interfacial, rim, allosteric, orthosteric) according to their properties and spatial locations. Systematic comparison of PPI cavities with pockets deduced from druggable protein-ligand complexes shows almost no overlap in property space, suggesting that even the most druggable PPI cavities are unlikely to be addressed with conventional drug-like compound libraries.
