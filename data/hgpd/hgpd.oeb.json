            "abstract": "The Human Gene and Protein Database (HGPD; http://www.HGPD.jp/) is a unique database that stores information on a set of human Gateway entry clones in addition to protein expression and protein synthesis data. The HGPD was launched in November 2008, and 33 275 human Gateway entry clones have been constructed from the open reading frames (ORFs) of full-length cDNA, thus representing the largest collection in the world. Recently, research objectives have focused on the development of new medicines and the establishment of novel diagnostic methods and medical treatments. And, studies using proteins and protein information, which are closely related to gene function, have been undertaken. For this update, we constructed an additional 9974 human Gateway entry clones, giving a total of 43 249. This set of human Gateway entry clones was named the Human Proteome Expression Resource, known as the 'HuPEX'. In addition, we also classified the clones into 10 groups according to protein function. Moreover, in vivo cellular localization data of proteins for 32 651 human Gateway entry clones were included for retrieval from the HGPD. In 'Information Overview', which presents the search results, the ORF region of each cDNA is now displayed allowing the Gateway entry clones to be searched more easily. Â© The Author(s) 2011.
