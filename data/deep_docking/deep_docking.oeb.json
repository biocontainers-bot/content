        "description": "a Deep Learning Approach for Virtual Screening of Big Chemical Datasets.\n\nABSTRACT Drug discovery is an extensive and rigorous process that requires up to 2 billion dollars of investments and more than ten years of research and development to bring a molecule “from bench to a bedside”. While virtual screening can significantly enhance drug discovery workflow, it ultimately lags the current rate of expansion of chemical databases that already incorporate billions of purchasable compounds. This surge of available small molecules presents great opportunities for drug discovery but also demands for faster virtual screening methods and protocols. In order to address this challenge, we herein introduce Deep Docking ( D 2 ) - a novel deep learning-based approach which is suited for docking billions of molecular structures.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
