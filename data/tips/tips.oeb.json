The identification of new targets of known drugs is a promising approach, which has proven successful in several cases. Here, we describe a database that includes information on 5153 putative drug-target pairs for 150 human pathogens derived from available drug-target crystallographic complexes.

Predictions are made using the information coming from drug-target three-dimensional complexes and by exploiting the homology relationships of known drug targets with pathogen proteins. Predicted pathogen targets are further annotated with sequence, structural and functional information.",
