  "sc:description": "The tool is designed to identify regions that are linked to a recessive disease by analysing genotype data from the parents and unaffected sibs of affected individuals. Since this analysis does not use data from affected patients, it is suited to the identification of lethal recessive genes, when the patients may have died before DNA samples could be obtained.",
