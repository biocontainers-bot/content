These materials were developed by university-based Preparedness and Emergency Response Learning Centers (PERLCs) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2010 to 2015. They mostly consist of online courses, as well as some exercises, toolkits and guides. The majority of available online PERLC materials are introductory-level, therefore, most of the content in this catalog is best suited for users who are looking to build awareness or begin their education in these topics.\n\nTo learn more about the development of this catalog, visit the About page.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'preparedness', 'emergency preparedness'",
