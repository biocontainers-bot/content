  This package contains some tools for processing BAM files including
  .
    bamsormadup:  parallel sorting and duplicate marking
    bamcollate2:  reads BAM and writes BAM reordered such that alignment
                  or collated by query name
    bammarkduplicates: reads BAM and writes BAM with duplicate alignments
                  marked using the BAM flags field
    bammaskflags: reads BAM and writes BAM while masking (removing) bits
                  from the flags column
    bamrecompress: reads BAM and writes BAM with a defined compression
                   setting. This tool is capable of multi-threading.
    bamsort:       reads BAM and writes BAM resorted by coordinates or
                   query name
    bamtofastq:    reads BAM and writes FastQ; output can be collated
                   or uncollated by query name
