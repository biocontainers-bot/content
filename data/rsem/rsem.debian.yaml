summary: RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization
description: >
  RSEM is a software package for estimating gene and isoform expression
  levels from RNA-Seq data. The RSEM package provides an user-friendly
  interface, supports threads for parallel computation of the EM
  algorithm, single-end and paired-end read data, quality scores,
  variable-length reads and RSPD estimation. In addition, it provides
  posterior mean and 95% credibility interval estimates for expression
  levels. For visualization, It can generate BAM and Wiggle files in both
  transcript-coordinate and genomic-coordinate. Genomic-coordinate files
  can be visualized by both UCSC Genome browser and Broad Instituteâ€™s
  Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). Transcript-coordinate files can be
  visualized by IGV. RSEM also has its own scripts to generate transcript
  read depth plots in pdf format. The unique feature of RSEM is, the read
  depth plots can be stacked, with read depth contributed to unique reads
  shown in black and contributed to multi-reads shown in red. In addition,
  models learned from data can also be visualized. Last but not least,
  RSEM contains a simulator.
