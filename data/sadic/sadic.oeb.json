Quantitative characterization of protein cores in relation to the corresponding structures and dynamics is needed to increase the reliability of protein engineering procedures. Unambiguous criteria based on atom depth considerations were established to assign amino acid residues to protein cores and, hence, for classifying inner and outer molecular moieties. These criteria were summarized in a new tool named ProCoCoA, Protein Core Composition Analyzer. An user-friendly web interface was developed, available at the URL: http://www.sbl.unisi.it/prococoa. An accurate estimate of protein core composition for six protein architectures selected from the CATH database of solved structures has been carried out, and the obtained results indicate the presence of specific patterns of amino acid core composition in different protein folds.
