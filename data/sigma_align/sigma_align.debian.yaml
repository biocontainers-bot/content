summary: Simple greedy multiple alignment of non-coding DNA sequences
description: >
  Sigma (“Simple greedy multiple alignment”) is an alignment program. It's
  algorithm and scoring scheme are designed specifically for non-coding
  DNA sequence.
  .
  It uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local
  alignments. This happens at each step making the best possible alignment
  consistent with existing alignments. It scores the significance of the
  alignment based on the lengths of the aligned fragments and a background
  model. These may be supplied or estimated from an auxiliary file of
  intergenic DNA.
