The resulting data are essential in documenting the mechanism of action and precision of endonucleolytically active, RNA-targeting drugs such as RNase H-active antisense or small interfering RNA. When applied to error-prone replication systems such as RNA viruses or in vitro RNA replicon systems, the method can additionally report the relative susceptibility of known and unknown polymorphisms to a prospective sequence-specific drug, making it a powerful tool in patient selection and stratification as well as resistance prediction. We describe the preparation of sequencing libraries for ultra-high depth 5′ RLM-RACE analysis on two popular second-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms (Illumina, Ion Torrent) and supply a detailed bioinformatics analysis pipeline for target site activity definition and enumeration. We further illustrate how the pipeline can be simply modified to generate polymorphism-specific drug susceptibility data from in vitro replicon experiments (RACE-SEQ-MM), in a patient-free manner, to cover both known and unknown target site variants in the population.",
