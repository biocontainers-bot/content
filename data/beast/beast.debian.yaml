summary: Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic inference
description: >
  BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
  sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
  phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It
  can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a
  framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a
  single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that
  each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
  is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard
  analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.
version: 1.10.4
no new upstream version of beast-mcmc (1.x) but rather a rewritten
  version.
version: 2.6.0
