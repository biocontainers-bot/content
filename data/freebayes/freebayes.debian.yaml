summary: Bayesian haplotype-based polymorphism discovery and genotyping
description: >
  FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find
  small polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide
  polymorphisms), indels (insertions and deletions), MNPs
  (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite
  insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a
  short-read sequencing alignment.
version: 1.3.2
