description: Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure
  that increases power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by assigning
  data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to IHW is a two-column table of
  p-values and covariates. The covariate can be any continuous-valued or categorical
  variable that is thought to be informative on the statistical properties of each
  hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value under the null hypothesis.
