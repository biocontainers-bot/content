summary: GNU R package to visualise long vector data
description: >
  This tool allows one to display very long data vectors in a space-efficient
  manner, by organising it along a 2D Hilbert curve. The user can then
  visually judge the large scale structure and distribution of features
  simultaenously with the rough shape and intensity of individual features.
  .
  In bioinformatics, a typical use case is ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq,
  or basically all the kinds of genomic data, that are conventionally
  displayed as quantitative track ("wiggle data") in genome browsers such
  as those provided by Ensembl or UCSC.
