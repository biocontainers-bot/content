summary: inference of homologous recombination in bacteria using whole genome sequences
description: >
  Bacteria, unlike us, can reproduce on their own. They do however have
  mechanisms that transfer DNA between organisms, a process more formally
  known as recombination. The mechanisms by which recombination takes
  place have been studied extensively in the laboratory but much remains
  to be understood concerning how, when and where recombination takes
  place within natural populations of bacteria and how it helps them to
  adapt to new environments. ClonalOrigin performs a comparative analysis
  of the sequences of a sample of bacterial genomes in order to
  reconstruct the recombination events that have taken place in their
  ancestry.
