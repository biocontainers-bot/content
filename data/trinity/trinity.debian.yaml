summary: RNA-Seq De novo Assembly
description: >
  Trinity represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo
  reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three
  independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied
  sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions
  the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the
  transcriptional complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes
  each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease
  apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.
