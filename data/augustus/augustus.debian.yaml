summary: gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes
description: >
  AUGUSTUS is a software for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences
  that is based on a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM), a probabilistic
  model of a sequence and its gene structure. After learning gene structures
  from a reference annotation, AUGUSTUS uses the HMM to recognize genes in a new
  sequence and annotates it with the regions of identified genes. External hints,
  e.g. from RNA sequencing, EST or protein alignments etc. can be used to guide
  and improve the gene finding process. The result is the set of most likely gene
  structures that comply with all given user constraints, if such gene
  structures exist.
  AUGUSTUS already includes prebuilt HMMs for many species, as well as scripts
  to train custom models using annotated genomes.
