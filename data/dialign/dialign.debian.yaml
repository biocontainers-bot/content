summary: Segment-based multiple sequence alignment
description: >
  DIALIGN2 is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of
  protein or DNA sequences. It constructs alignments from gapfree pairs
  of similar segments of the sequences. This scoring scheme for
  alignments is the basic difference between DIALIGN and other global or
  local alignment methods. Note that DIALIGN does not employ any kind of
  gap penalty.
