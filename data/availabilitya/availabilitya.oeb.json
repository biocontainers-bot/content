Transcription factors and other chromatin associated proteins act as combinatorial protein complexes that control gene transcription. Thus, identifying functional interaction networks among these proteins is a fundamental task to understand the genome regulation framework. RESULTS:We developed a novel approach to infer interactions among transcription factors in user selected genomic regions, by combining the computation of association rules and of a novel Importance Index on ChIP-seq data sets",
