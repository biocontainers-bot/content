summary: suite of utilities for comparing genomic features
description: >
  The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as
  finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are largely
  based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM. Using
  BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer complicated
  research questions by streaming several BEDTools together.
  .
  The groupBy utility is distributed in the filo package.
version: 2.29.2
