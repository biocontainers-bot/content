description: The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet
  Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model selection
  to decide at each step which clusters to merge.  This avoids several limitations
  of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should be and how to
  choose a principled distance metric.  This implementation accepts multinomial (i.e.
  discrete, with 2+ categories) or time-series data. This version also includes a
  randomised algorithm which is more efficient for larger data sets.
