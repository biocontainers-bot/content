        "description": "An Efficient Semi-Implicit Solver for Compressible Flows.\n\nThe computing power of smartphones has not received considerable attention in the mainstream education system. Most of the education-oriented smartphone applications (apps) are limited to general purpose services like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), language learning, and calculators (performing basic mathematical calculations). Greater potential of smartphones lies in educators and researchers developing their customized apps for learners in highly specific domains. In line with this, we present Fluid Dynamics, a highly accurate Android application for measuring flow properties in compressible flows. This app can determine properties across the stationary normal and oblique shock, moving normal shock and across Prandtl $-$ Meyer expansion fan.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'app', 'semi-implicit', 'flows', 'compressible'",
