summary: assemble short RNAseq reads to transcripts
description: >
  The abundance of transcripts in a human tissue sample
  can be determined by RNA sequencing. The exact sequence
  sampled may be random, depending on the technology used.
  And it may be short, i.e. shorter than the transcript.
  At some point, many shorter reads need to be assembled
  to the model the complete transcripts.
  .
  StringTie knows how to assemble of RNA-Seq into potential
  transcripts without the need of a reference genome and
  provides a quantification also of the splice variants.
