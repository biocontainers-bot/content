            "abstract": "Â© 2018 American Chemical Society. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a predominant choice for large-scale absolute protein quantification, but its quantification accuracy still has substantial room for improvement. A crucial issue is the bias between the peptide MS intensity and the actual peptide abundance, i.e., the fact that peptides with equal abundance may have different MS intensities. This bias is mainly caused by the diverse physicochemical properties of peptides. Here, we propose an algorithm for label-free absolute protein quantification, LFAQ, which can correct the biased MS intensities by using the predicted peptide quantitative factors for all identified peptides. When validated on data sets produced by different MS instruments and data acquisition modes, LFAQ presented accuracy and precision superior to those of existing methods. In particular, it reduced the quantification error by an average of 46% for low-abundance proteins. The advantages of LFAQ were further confirmed using the data from published papers.",
