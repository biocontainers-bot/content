        "description": "A deep learning framework for improving protein interaction prediction using sequence properties.\n\nAbstract Motivation Almost all critical functions and processes in cells are sustained by the cellular networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of biological systems. Despite all past efforts, we still lack high-quality PPI data for constructing the networks, which makes it challenging to study the functions of association of proteins. High-throughput experimental techniques have produced abundant data for systematically studying the cellular networks of a biological system and the development of computational method for PPI identification.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME (iPPI) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ippi (IPPI).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'deep learning-based', 'deep learning'",
