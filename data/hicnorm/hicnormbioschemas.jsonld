  "sc:description": "HiCNorm is a parametric model to remove systematic biases in the raw Hi-C contact maps. It relates chromatin interactions and systemic biases at the desired resolution level,resulting in a simple, yet accurate normalization procedure. Compared to the exiting Hi-C normalization method, our model has only a few parameters, is much easier to implement, can be interpreted intuitively, and achieves higher reproducibility in real Hi-C data",
