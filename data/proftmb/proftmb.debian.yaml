summary: per-residue prediction of bacterial transmembrane beta barrels
description: >
  proftmb predicts transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins in Gram-negative
  bacteria.
  .
  For each query protein, proftmb provides both a Z-value indicating that the
  protein actually contains a membrane barrel, and a four-state per-residue
  labeling of upward- and downward-facing strands, periplasmic hairpins and
  extracellular loops.
