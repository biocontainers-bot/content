biotools_id: cosmiq
description: cosmiq is a tool for the preprocessing of liquid- or gas - chromatography
  mass spectrometry (LCMS/GCMS) data with a focus on metabolomics or lipidomics applications.
  To improve the detection of low abundant signals, cosmiq generates master maps of
  the mZ/RT space from all acquired runs before a peak detection algorithm is applied.
  The result is a more robust identification and quantification of low-intensity MS
  signals compared to conventional approaches where peak picking is performed in each
  LCMS/GCMS file separately. The cosmiq package builds on the xcmsSet object structure
  and can be therefore integrated well with the package xcms as an alternative preprocessing
  step.
