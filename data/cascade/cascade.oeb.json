They allow highlighting the more influential genes and spotting some targets for biological intervention experiments. Despite that many reverse engineering tools have been designed, the Cascade package is an integrated solution adding several new and original key features such as the ability to predict changes in gene expressions after a biological perturbation in the network and graphical outputs that allow monitoring the spread of a signal through the network.Availability and implementation: The R package Cascade is available online at http://www-math.u-strasbg.fr/genpred/spip.php?rubrique4.
