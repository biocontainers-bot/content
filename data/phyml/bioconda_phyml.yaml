description: 'PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from

  alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The main strength of

  PhyML lies in the large number of substitution models coupled to various

  options to search the space of phylogenetic tree topologies, going from

  very fast and efficient methods to slower but generally more accurate

  approaches. PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In

  theory, alignments with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long

  can be processed. PhyML can process data sets made of multiple genes and

  fit sophisticated substitution models with heterogeneous components

  across partition elements.
