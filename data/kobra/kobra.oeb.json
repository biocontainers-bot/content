In addition, a user-friendly program with graphical user interface has been developed and is freely provided to be used (https://sourceforge.net/projects/kobra/). It needs from the user just to provide the values of the unit cell lengths and angles, the transition rate constants for each sorbate, and any spatial constraint between these sorbates. This program is shown to be about 30 times faster than kinetic Monte Carlo method. Application of the method to the problem of diffusion of aromatics in silicalite-1 at different loadings is presented too. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
