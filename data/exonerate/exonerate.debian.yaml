summary: generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison
description: >
  Exonerate allows you to align sequences using a many alignment models, using
  either exhaustive dynamic programming, or a variety of heuristics. Much of
  the functionality of the Wise dynamic programming suite was reimplemented in C
  for better efficiency. Exonerate is an intrinsic component of the building of
  the Ensembl genome databases, providing similarity scores between RNA and DNA
  sequences and thus determining splice variants and coding sequences in
  general.
  .
  An In-silico PCR Experiment Simulation System (see the ipcress man page) is
  packaged with exonerate.
  .
  This package also comes with a selection of utilities for performing
  simple manipulations quickly on fasta files beyond 2Gb
version: 2.4.0
