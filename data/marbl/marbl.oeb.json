This application is implemented for Linux and is written in Mumps, C, and C++ with supporting components that include the Berkeley Data Base, the Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library, GLADE, and tools such as FASTA, Smith-Waterman, and modules from EMBOSS. The package described here can quickly index data sets of up to 256 terabytes using a B-tree based multi-dimensional data model. An example is presented that indexes the text of the full NCBI Genbank library. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
