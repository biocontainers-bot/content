Here we present PLAN2L, a web-based online search system that integrates text mining and information extraction techniques to access systematically information useful for analyzing genetic, cellular and molecular aspects of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Our system facilitates a more efficient retrieval of information relevant to heterogeneous biological topics, from implications in biological relationships at the level of protein interactions and gene regulation, to sub-cellular locations of gene products and associations to cellular and developmental processes, i.e. cell cycle, flowering, root, leaf and seed development. Beyond single entities, also predefined pairs of entities can be provided as queries for which literature-derived relations together with textual evidences are returned. PLAN2L does not require registration and is freely accessible at http://zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/plan2l.",
