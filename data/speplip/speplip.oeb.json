SPEPlip identifies the presence of sorting signals and predicts their cleavage sites. The accuracy in cross-validation is similar to that of other available programs: the rate of false positives is 4 and 6%, for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively and that of false negatives is 3% in both cases. When a set of 409 prokaryotic lipoproteins is predicted, SPEPlip predicts 97% of the chains in the signal peptide class. However, by integrating SPEPlip with a regular expression search utility based on the PROSITE pattern, we can successfully discriminate signal peptide-containing chains from lipoproteins. We propose the method for detecting and discriminating signal peptides containing chains and lipoproteins. Â© Oxford University Press 2001.",
