Results: We developed new algorithms and a software tool 'Multiple Genome Aligner' (MGA for short) that efficiently computes multiple genome alignments of large, closely related DNA sequences. For example, it can align 85% percent of the complete genomes of six human adenoviruses (average length 35305 bp.) in 159 seconds. An alignment of 74% of the complete genomes of three of strains of E. coli (lengths: 5528445; 5498450; 4639221 bp.) is produced in 30 minutes. Availability: The software MGA is available free of charge for non-commercial research institutions. © Oxford University Press 2001.",

MGA  is a software tool for efficiently aligning two or more sufficiently similar genomic sized sequences [HKO02]. It belongs to the category of anchor-based multiple alignment methods. mga uses multiMEMs (or MEMs, MUMs as special cases) to anchor the alignment. In essence, they are (hopefully long) stretches or regions of identical bases occuring in all input sequences.",
