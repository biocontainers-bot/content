summary: Multiple Sequence Alignment
description: >
  T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment package. Given a set of
  sequences (Proteins or DNA), T-Coffee generates a multiple sequence
  alignment. Version 2.00 and higher can mix sequences and structures.
  .
  T-Coffee allows the combination of a collection of multiple/pairwise,
  global or local alignments into a single model. It can also
  estimate the level of consistency of each position within the new
  alignment with the rest of the alignments. See the pre-print for more
  information
  .
  T-Coffee has a special called M-Coffee that makes it possible to combine the
  output of many multiple sequence alignment packages. In its published version,
  it uses MUSCLE, PROBCONS, POA, DiAlign-TS, MAFFT, Clustal W, PCMA and
  T-Coffee.  A special version has been made for Debian, DM-Coffee, that uses
  only free software by replacing Clustal W by Kalign. Using the 8 Methods of
  M-Coffee can sometimes be a bit heavy. You can use a subset of your favorite
  methods if you prefer.
version: 12.00.7fb08c2
