summary: post-processing of high-throughput DNA sequence reads
description: >
  skewer implements the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm
  dedicated to the task of adapter trimming and it is specially designed
  for processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) paired-end sequences.
  .
  Features
  .
   * Detection and removal of adapter sequences
   * Insertion and deletion allowed in pattern matching
   * Targeted at Single End, Paired End (PE), and Long Mate Pair (LMP) reads
   * Demultiplexing of barcoded sequencing runs
   * Multi-threading support
   * Trimming based on phred quality scores
   * IUPAC characters for barcodes and adapters
   * Compressed input and output support
version: 0.2.2
