summary: tools for comparing DNA sequences with MinHash sketches
description: >
  Compute MinHash signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein sequences.
  .
  MinHash sketches provide a lightweight way to store “signatures” of large DNA
  or RNA sequence collections, and then compare or search them using a Jaccard
  index. MinHash sketches can be used to identify samples, find similar samples,
  identify data sets with shared sequences, and build phylogenetic trees
  (Ondov et al. 2015).
  .
  sourmash provides a command line script, a Python library, and a CPython
  module for MinHash sketches
