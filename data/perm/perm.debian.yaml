summary: efficient mapping of short reads with periodic spaced seeds
description: >
  PerM is a software package which was designed to perform highly efficient
  genome scale alignments for hundreds of millions of short reads produced by
  the ABI SOLiD and Illumina sequencing platforms. Today PerM is capable of
  providing full sensitivity for alignments within 4 mismatches for 50bp SOLID
  reads and 9 mismatches for 100bp Illumina reads.
