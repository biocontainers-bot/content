The toolkit includes modules written in Java and in the R statistical programming language to aid the rapid development of proteomics software applications. It contains tools for processing and manipulating standard MS data files, including signal processing of LC-MS data and parsing of MS/MS search results, as well as for modeling proteomics data structures, creating charts, and other common tasks. We present this toolkit's capability to rapidly develop new computational tools by presenting an example application, Qurate, a graphical tool for manually curating isotopically labeled peptide quantitative events.
