It can be used to analyzed CLIP-seq and ChIP-seq data, as well as to calculate the differential enrichment of CLIP-seq, ChIP-seq and other types of datasets between two conditions, with or without replicates. It also includes a number of useful tools for the transformation and manipulation of genomic-based datasets.",
