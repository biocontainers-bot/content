summary: highly parametrizable pairwise global genome sequence aligner
description: >
  Lagan takes local alignments generated by CHAOS as anchors, and limits
  the search area of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm around these anchors.
  .
  Multi-LAGAN is a generalization of the pairwise algorithm to multiple
  sequence alignment.  M-LAGAN performs progressive pairwise alignments,
  guided by a user-specified phylogenetic tree. Alignments are aligned to
  other alignments using the sum-of-pairs metric.
