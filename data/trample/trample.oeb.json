HTP is a neural network- based tool which gives as output the protein membrane topology based on the statistical propensity of residues to be located in external and internal loops. This method, which uses single protein sequences as input to the network system, correctly predicts the topology of 71 out of 92 membrane proteins of putative membrane orientation, independently of the protein source.",

            "abstract": "Motivation: Membrane proteins are an abundant and functionally relevant subset of proteins that putatively include from about 15 up to 30% of the proteome of organisms fully sequenced. These estimates are mainly computed on the basis of sequence comparison and membrane protein prediction. It is therefore urgent to develop methods capable of selecting membrane proteins especially in the case of outer membrane proteins, barely taken into consideration when proteome wide analysis is performed. This will also help protein annotation when no homologous sequence is found in the database. Outer membrane proteins solved so far at atomic resolution interact with the external membrane of bacteria with a characteristic β barrel structure comprising different even numbers of β strands (β barrel membrane proteins). In this they differ from the membrane proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane endowed with alpha helix bundles (all alpha membrane proteins) and need specialised predictors. Results: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of β barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. The model is cyclic with 6 types of states: two for the β strand transmembrane core, one for the β strand cap on either side of the membrane, one for the inner loop, one for the outer loop and one for the globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The development of a specific input for HMM based on multiple sequence alignment is novel. The accuracy per residue of the model is 83% when a jack knife procedure is adopted. With a model optimisation method using a dynamic programming algorithm seven topological models out of the twelve proteins included in the testing set are also correctly predicted. When used as a discriminator, the model is rather selective. At a fixed probability value, it retains 84% of a non-redundant set comprising 145 sequences of well-annotated outer membrane proteins. Concomitantly, it correctly rejects 90% of a set of globular proteins including about 1200 chains with low sequence identity (<30%) and 90% of a set of all alpha membrane proteins, including 188 chains.

Here, we describe an improvement and an extension of that system. The improvement is achieved by a dynamic programming-like algorithm that optimizes helices compatible with the neural network output. The extension is the prediction of topology (orientation of first loop region with respect to membrane) by applying to the refined prediction the observation that positively charged residues are more abundant in extra-cytoplasmic regions. Furthermore, we introduce a method to reduce the number of false positives, i.e., proteins falsely predicted with membrane helices. The evaluation of prediction accuracy is based on a cross-validation and a double-blind test set (in total 131 proteins). The final method appears to be more accurate than other methods published: (1) For almost 89% (±3%) of the test proteins, all HTMs are predicted correctly. (2) For more than 86% (±3%) of the proteins, topology is predicted correctly. (3) We define reliability indices that correlate with prediction accuracy: for one half of the proteins, segment accuracy raises to 98%; and for two-thirds, accuracy of topology prediction is 95%. (4) The rate of proteins for which HTMs are predicted falsely is below 2% (±1%). Finally, the method is applied to 1,616 sequences of Haemophilus influenzae. We predict 19% of the genome sequences to contain one or more HTMs. This appears to be lower than what we predicted previously for the yeast VIII chromosome (about 25%).",
