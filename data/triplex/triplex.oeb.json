            "abstract": "Motivation: Upgrade and integration of triplex software into the R/Bioconductor framework.Results: We combined a previously published implementation of a triplex DNA search algorithm with visualization to create a versatile R/Bioconductor package 'triplex'. The new package provides functions that can be used to search Bioconductor genomes and other DNA sequence data for occurrence of nucleotide patterns capable of forming intramolecular triplexes (H-DNA). Functions producing 2D and 3D diagrams of the identified triplexes allow instant visualization of the search results. Leveraging the power of Biostrings and GRanges classes, the results get fully integrated into the existing Bioconductor framework, allowing their passage to other Genome visualization and annotation packages, such as GenomeGraphs, rtracklayer or Gviz.Availability: R package 'triplex' is available from Bioconductor (bioconductor.org).Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

The main functionality is to detect the positions of subsequences capable of folding into an intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) in a much larger sequence. The potential H-DNA (triplexes) should be made of as many cannonical nucleotide triplets as possible. The package includes visualization showing the exact base-pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D.",
