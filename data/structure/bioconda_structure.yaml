summary: The program structure is a free software package for using multi-locus genotype
  data to investigate population structure. Its uses include inferring the presence
  of distinct populations, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones,
  identifying migrants and admixed individuals, and estimating population allele frequencies
  in situations where many individuals are migrants or admixed. It can be applied
  to most of the commonly-used genetic markers, including SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs
  and AFLPs.
