            "abstract": "Summary: Low-complexity, repetitive protein sequences with a limited amino acid palette are abundant in nature, and many of them play an important role in the structure and function of certain types of proteins. However, such repetitive sequences often do not have rigidly defined motifs. Consequently, the identification of these low-complexity repetitive elements has proven challenging for existing pattern-matching algorithms. Here we introduce a new web-tool SubSeqer (http://compsysbio.org/subseqer/) which uses graphical visualization methods borrowed from protein interaction studies to identify and characterize repetitive elements in low-complexity sequences. Given their abundance, we suggest that SubSeqer represents a valuable resource for the study of typically neglected low-complexity sequences. Â© The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.
