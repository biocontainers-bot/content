description: Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by probabilistically
  modelling the likelihood microRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based
  scores. Variaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied to log fold-changes
  and sequence scores to obtain the posteriors of latent variable being the miRNA
  targets. The final targetScore is computed as the sigmoid-transformed fold-change
  weighted by the averaged posteriors of target components over all of the features.
