summary: Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood
description: >
  TREE-PUZZLE (the new name for PUZZLE) is an interactive console program that
  implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows
  analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support
  to each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum
  likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified trees.
  Branch lengths can also be calculated under the clock-assumption. In
  addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to
  investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without
  computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of
  a sequence alignment.
