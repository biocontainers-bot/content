description: We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was
  established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of
  true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions
  are considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution. Given
  measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals,
  assuming governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus
  the accurate detection of differential expressed genes.
