description: This is a Hi-C analysis package using a cumulative binomial test to detect
  interactions between distal genomic loci that have significantly more reads than
  expected by chance in Hi-C experiments. It takes mapped paired NGS reads as input
  and gives back the list of significant interactions for a given bin size in the
  genome.
