summary: maps short fixed-length polymorphic DNA sequence reads to reference sequences
description: >
  Maq (short for Mapping and Assembly with Quality) builds mapping assemblies
  from short reads generated by the next-generation sequencing machines. It was
  particularly designed for Illumina-Solexa 1G Genetic Analyzer, and has a
  preliminary functionality to handle ABI SOLiD data. Maq is previously known as
  mapass2.
  .
  Developmemt of Maq stopped in 2008. Its successors are BWA and SAMtools.
