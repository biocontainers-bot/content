The purpose of our work is to extend the strength of the first package and to build a more efficient environment. Such an environment should be able to fulfill the different needs and requirements arising from both the growing use of 2-DE techniques and the increasing amount of distributed experimental data.",

The tool offers the possibility to automatically update data related to numerous external data resources. It is also possible to dynamically interconnect several remote databases or projects to form a virtual global database accessible from one single entry point. This tool can also be used to build up 2D-PAGE repositories, accessible by any one from the Web.",
