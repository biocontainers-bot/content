description: Package to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in target
  organisms for which only a view information about PPIs is available. Path2PPI predicts
  PPI networks based on sets of proteins which can belong to a certain pathway from
  well-established model organisms. It helps to combine and transfer information of
  a certain pathway or biological process from several reference organisms to one
  target organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity of the involved
  proteins.
