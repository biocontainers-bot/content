summary: GNU R significance analysis of microarrays
description: >
  This GNU R package provides significance analysis of microarrays.
  A microarray is a multiplex lab-on-a-chip. It is a 2D array on a solid
  substrate (usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays
  large amounts of biological material using high-throughput screening
  miniaturized, multiplexed and parallel processing and detection methods.
  .
  This package helps analysing this kind of microarrays.
