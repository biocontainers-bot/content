            "abstract": "Protein-protein complexes play key roles in all cellular signal transduction processes. We have developed a fast and accurate computational approach to predict changes in the binding free energy upon alanine mutations in protein-protein interfaces. The approach is based on a knowledge-based scoring function, DrugScorePPI, for which pair potentials were derived from 851 complex structures and adapted against 309 experi-mental alanine scanning results. Based on this approach, we developed the DrugScorePPI webserver. The input consists of a protein-protein complex structure; the output is a summary table and bar plot of binding free energy differences for wild-type residue-to-Ala mutations. The results of the analysis are mapped on the protein-protein complex structure and visualized using Jmol. A single interface can be analyzed within a few minutes. Our approach has been successfully validated by application to an external test set of 22 alanine mutations in the interface of Ras/RalGDS. The DrugScorePPI webserver is primarily intended for identifying hotspot residues in protein-protein interfaces, which provides valuable information for guiding biological experi-ments and in the development of protein-protein interaction modulators. The DrugScorePPI Webserver, accessible at http://cpclab.uni-duesse ldorf.de/dsppi, is free and open to all users with no login requirement. Â© The Author(s) 2010.
