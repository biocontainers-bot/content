summary: Read Assignment Method Based On K-mers
description: >
  RAMBO-K is a tool for rapid and sensitive removal of background sequences
  from Next Generation Sequencing data.
  .
  RAMBO-K is a reference-based tool for rapid and sensitive extraction of
  one organisms reads from a mixed dataset. It is based on a Markov chain
  implementation, which uses genomic characteristics of each reference to
  assign reads to the associated set.
