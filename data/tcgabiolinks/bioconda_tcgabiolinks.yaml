description: 'The aim of TCGAbiolinks is : i) facilitate the GDC open-access data
  retrieval, ii) prepare the data using the appropriate pre-processing strategies,
  iii) provide the means to carry out different standard analyses and iv) to easily
  reproduce earlier research results. In more detail, the package provides multiple
  methods for analysis (e.g., differential expression analysis, identifying differentially
  methylated regions) and methods for visualization (e.g., survival plots, volcano
  plots, starburst plots) in order to easily develop complete analysis pipelines.'
