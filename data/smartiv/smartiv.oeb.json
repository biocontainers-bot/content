Gene expression regulation is highly dependent on binding of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to their RNA targets. Growing evidence supports the notion that both RNA primary sequence and its local secondary structure play a role in specific Protein-RNA recognition and binding. Despite the great advance in high-throughput experimental methods for identifying sequence targets of RBPs, predicting the specific sequence and structure binding preferences of RBPs remains a major challenge. We present a novel webserver, SMARTIV, designed for discovering and visualizing combined RNA sequence and structure motifs from high-throughput RNA-binding data, generated from in-vivo experiments. The uniqueness of SMARTIV is that it predicts motifs from enriched k-mers that combine information from ranked RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structure, obtained using various folding methods. Consequently, SMARTIV generates Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in a combined sequence and structure alphabet with assigned P-values. SMARTIV concisely represents the sequence and structure motif content as a single graphical logo, which is informative and easy for visual perception. SMARTIV was examined extensively on a variety of high-throughput binding experiments for RBPs from different families, generated from different technologies, showing consistent and accurate results. Finally, SMARTIV is a user-friendly webserver, highly efficient in run-time and freely accessible via http://smartiv.technion.ac.il/.",
