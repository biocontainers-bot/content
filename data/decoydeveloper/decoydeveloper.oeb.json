            "abstract": "Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.Glycopeptide analysis is a growing field that is struggling to adopt effective, automated tools. Many creative workflows and software apps have emerged recently that offer promising capabilities for assigning glycopeptides to MS data in an automated fashion. The effectiveness of these tools is best measured and improved by determining how often they would select a glycopeptide decoy as a spectral match, instead of its correct assignment; yet generating the appropriate number and type of glycopeptide decoys can be challenging. To address this need, we have designed DecoyDeveloper, an on-demand decoy glycopeptide generator that can produce a high volume of decoys with low mass differences. DecoyDeveloper has a simple user interface and is capable of producing large sets of decoys containing complete, biologically relevant glycan and peptide sequences. We demonstrate the tool's efficiency by applying it to a set of 80 glycopeptide targets. This tool is freely available and can be found at http://glycopro.chem.ku.edu/J1.php.",
