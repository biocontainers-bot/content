summary: hybrid assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes
description: >
  Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can assemble
  Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser. It can
  also assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a
  miniasm+Racon pipeline. For the best possible assemblies, give it both
  Illumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a hybrid assembly.
version: 0.4.8
