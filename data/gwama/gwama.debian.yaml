summary: Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis
description: >
  GWAMA (Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis) software performs
  meta-analysis of the results of GWA studies of binary or
  quantitative phenotypes. Fixed- and random-effect meta-analyses are
  performed for both directly genotyped and imputed SNPs using
  estimates of the allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for
  binary traits, and estimates of the allelic effect size and standard
  error for quantitative phenotypes. GWAMA can be used for analysing
  the results of all different genetic models (multiplicative,
  additive, dominant, recessive). The software incorporates error
  trapping facilities to identify strand alignment errors and allele
  flipping, and performs tests of heterogeneity of effects between studies.
