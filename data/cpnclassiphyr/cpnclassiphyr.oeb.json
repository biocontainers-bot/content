            "abstract": "Phytoplasmas are plant-pathogenic bacteria that are associated with yield losses in many crop plants worldwide. Phytoplasma strain differentiation is accomplished using in silico restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding gene sequences, which has resulted in the definition of ribosomal groups and subgroups of phytoplasmas. Due to limitations associated with this approach, a complementary classification scheme was recently developed based on RFLP analysis of the single-copy, protein-encoding gene chaperonin-60 (cpn60). We present the CpnClassiPhyR, software that facilitates phytoplasma strain classification using both RFLP and automated phylogenetic analysis of cpn60 sequences. This software is available through a web interface at http://cpnclassiphyr.ca.",
