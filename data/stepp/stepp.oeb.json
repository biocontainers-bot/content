            "abstract": "Motivation: The standard approach to identifying peptides based on accurate mass and elution time (AMT) compares profiles obtained from a high resolution mass spectrometer to a database of peptides previously identified from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) studies. It would be advantageous, with respect to both accuracy and cost, to only search for those peptides that are detectable by MS (proteotypic). Results: We present a support vector machine (SVM) model that uses a simple descriptor space based on 35 properties of amino acid content, charge, hydrophilicity and polarity for the quantitative prediction of proteotypic peptides. Using three independently derived AMT databases (Shewanella oneidensis, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis) for training and validation within and across species, the SVM resulted in an average accuracy measure of ~0.83 with an SD of <0.038. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these results are achievable with a small set of 13 variables and can achieve high proteome coverage. Availability: http://omics.pnl.gov/software/STEPP.php.
