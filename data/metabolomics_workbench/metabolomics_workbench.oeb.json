        "description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | Lipid profiling dataset of the Wnt3a-induced optic nerve regeneration | About the Metabolomics Workbench: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund Metabolomics Program was developed with the goal of increasing national capacity in metabolomics by supporting the development of next generation technologies, providing training and mentoring opportunities, increasing the inventory and availability of high quality reference standards, and promoting data sharing and collaboration. In support of this effort, the Metabolomics Program's Data Repository and Coordinating Center (DRCC), housed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), University of California, San Diego, has developed the Metabolomics Workbench. The Metabolomics Workbench will serve as a national and international repository for metabolomics data and metadata and will provide analysis tools and access to metabolite standards, protocols, tutorials, training, and more",
