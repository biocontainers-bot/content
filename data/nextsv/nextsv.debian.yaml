summary: automated structural variation detection for long-read sequencing
description: >
  NextSV is an computational pipeline that allows structural variant (SV)
  calling from PacBio sequencing data using PBhoney and Sniffles. NextSV takes
  FASTA or FASTQ files as input. Once the SV caller is selected by user, NextSV
  automatically chooses the compatible aligner and performs mapping. The
  alignments will be automatically sorted and then presented to the SV caller.
  Users can change the parameters by modifying its configuration file. When the
  analysis is finished, NextSV will examine the FASTA/FASTQ, BAM, and result
  files and generate a report showing various statistics. If more than both
  callers are selected, NextSV will format the raw result files (.tails, .spots,
  or .vcf files) into bed files and generate the intersection or union call set
  for the purpose of higher accuracy or sensitivity.
