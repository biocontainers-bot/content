Perturbations of secondary RNA structures may play an important role in an organism's reaction to temperature change--in all organisms from viruses and bacteria to humans. Here, we present RNAtips (temperature-induced perturbation of structure) web server, which can be used to predict regions of RNA secondary structures that are likely to undergo structural alterations prompted by temperature change. The server can also be used to: (i) detect those regions in two homologous RNA sequences that undergo different structural perturbations due to temperature change and (ii) test whether these differences are specific to the particular nucleotide substitutions distinguishing the sequences. The RNAtips web server is freely accessible without any login requirement at http://rnatips.org.",
