As a result, these devices are now expected to make an efficient and dynamic use of the spectrum, and to provide processed information instead of simple raw sensor measurements. These communication and processing requirements have direct implications on the architecture of the systems. In this work, we present MIGOU, a wireless experimental platform that has been designed to address these challenges from the perspective of resource-constrained devices, such as wireless sensor nodes or IoT end-devices.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'wireless', 'system-on-a-chip'",
