summary: taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches
description: >
  Kraken 2 is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification
  system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast
  classification speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query
  sequence to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing
  the given k-mer. The k-mer assignments inform the classification
  algorithm. [see: Kraken 1's Webpage for more details].
  .
  Kraken 2 provides significant improvements to Kraken 1, with faster
  database build times, smaller database sizes, and faster classification
  speeds. These improvements were achieved by the following updates to the
  Kraken classification program:
  .
   1. Storage of Minimizers: Instead of storing/querying entire k-mers,
      Kraken 2 stores minimizers (l-mers) of each k-mer. The length of
      each l-mer must be â‰¤ the k-mer length. Each k-mer is treated by
      Kraken 2 as if its LCA is the same as its minimizer's LCA.
   2. Introduction of Spaced Seeds: Kraken 2 also uses spaced seeds to
      store and query minimizers to improve classification accuracy.
   3. Database Structure: While Kraken 1 saved an indexed and sorted list
      of k-mer/LCA pairs, Kraken 2 uses a compact hash table. This hash
      table is a probabilistic data structure that allows for faster
      queries and lower memory requirements. However, this data structure
      does have a <1% chance of returning the incorrect LCA or returning
      an LCA for a non-inserted minimizer. Users can compensate for this
      possibility by using Kraken's confidence scoring thresholds.
   4. Protein Databases: Kraken 2 allows for databases built from amino
      acid sequences. When queried, Kraken 2 performs a six-frame
      translated search of the query sequences against the database.
   5. 16S Databases: Kraken 2 also provides support for databases not
      based on NCBI's taxonomy. Currently, these include the 16S
      databases: Greengenes, SILVA, and RDP.
