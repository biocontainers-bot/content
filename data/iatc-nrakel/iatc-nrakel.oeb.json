Seven drug networks were constructed according to the chemical associations reported in STITCH and KEGG, from which informative drug features were produced via Mashup. Obtained features were tackled by random k-Labelsets (RAKEL) algorithm, in which support vector machine (SVM) was adopted as prediction engine, to build the multi-label classifier, iATC-NRAKEL. Through rigorous 10-fold cross-validation, iATC-NRAKEL yielded the absolute true of 74.51% and accuracy of 76.56%. The Jackknife test results were 75.93% (absolute true) and 77.86% (accuracy), which were much higher than those yiedled by all previous classifers",
