In the first step, a historical population is simulated to establish mutation-drift equilibrium, and in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be very complex. A wide variety of genome architectures, ranging from infinitesimal model to single-locus model, can be simulated. The program is efficient in terms of computing time and memory requirements.
