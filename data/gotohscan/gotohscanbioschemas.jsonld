  "sc:description": "The GotohScan program is a search tool that finds shorter sequences (usually genes) in large database sequences (chromosomes, genomes, ..)by computing all semi-global alignments. Â Thus, the query sequence is never truncated or split into subsequences, but always mapped to the database over its complete length. The alignment is computed via the Gotoh-alignment algorithm using affine gap costs.",
