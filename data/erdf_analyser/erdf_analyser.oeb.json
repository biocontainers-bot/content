It is developed as an integrated tool with an easy-to-use interface that offers a streamlined approach to extract RDF from electron diffraction data without the need for external routines. The software incorporates recent developments in scattering factor parameterisation and an automated fitting routine for the atomic scattering curve. It also features an automated optimisation routine for determination of the position of the centre of diffraction patterns recorded using both central and off-centre locations of the incident beam. It is available in both open source code (MATLAB m-file) and executable form.",
