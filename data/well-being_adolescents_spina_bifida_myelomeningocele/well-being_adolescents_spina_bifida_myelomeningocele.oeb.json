However, little research is available in low-income nations such as South Africa. Investigating the contributors and hindrances to well-being in adolescents with spina bifida myelomeningocele may yield novel insights. In this study we included both adolescents and their primary caregivers to examine their perspectives on caring for and facilitating improvements in the life of the adolescents living with spina bifida myelomeningocele",
