summary: processing sequence alignments in SAM, BAM and CRAM formats
description: >
  Samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate nucleotide sequence alignments
  in the binary BAM format. It imports from and exports to the ascii SAM
  (Sequence Alignment/Map) and CRAM formats, does sorting, merging and indexing,
  and allows one to retrieve reads in any regions swiftly. It is designed to work
  on a stream, and is able to open a BAM or CRAM (not SAM) file on a remote FTP
  or HTTP server.
