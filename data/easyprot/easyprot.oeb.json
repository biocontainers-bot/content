            "abstract": "High throughput protein identification and quantification analysis based on mass spectrometry are fundamental steps in most proteomics projects. Here, we present EasyProt (available at http://easyprot.unige.ch), a new platform for mass spectrometry data processing, protein identification, quantification and unexpected post-translational modification characterization. EasyProt provides a fully integrated graphical experience to perform a large part of the proteomic data analysis workflow. Our goal was to develop a software platform that would fulfill the needs of scientists in the field, while emphasizing ease-of-use for non-bioinformatician users. Protein identification is based on OLAV scoring schemes and protein quantification is implemented for both, isobaric labeling and label-free methods. Additional features are available, such as peak list processing, isotopic correction, spectra filtering, charge-state deconvolution and spectra merging. To illustrate the EasyProt platform, we present two identification and quantification workflows based on isobaric tagging and label-free methods. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.",
