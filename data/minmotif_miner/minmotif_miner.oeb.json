We have constructed a motif database comprising 312 unique motifs and a web-based tool for identifying motifs in proteins. Functional motifs predicted by MnM can be ranked by several approaches, and we validated these scores by analyzing thousands of confirmed examples and by confirming prediction of previously unidentified 14-3-3 motifs in EFF-1.",

Here we report the third release of the MnM database which has now grown 60-fold to approximately 300 000 minimotifs. Since short minimotifs are by their nature not very complex we also summarize a new set of false-positive filters and linear regression scoring that vastly enhance minimotif prediction accuracy on a test data set. This online database can be used to predict new functions in proteins and causes of disease. © The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.",
