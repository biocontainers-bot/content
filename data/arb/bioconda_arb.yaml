description: '"ARB (ARBor, Latin: tree): A software environment for maintaining

  databases of molecular sequences and additional information, and

  for analyzing the sequence data, with emphasis on phylogeny

  reconstruction.


  The programs have primarily been developed for ribosomal

  ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences and, therefore, contain special

  tools for alignment and analysis of these structures. However,

  other molecular sequence data can also be handled. Protein gene

  sequences and predicted protein primary structures as well as

  protein secondary structures can be stored in the same database.


  The ARB package is designed for graphical user interface. Program

  control and data display are available in a hierarchical set of

  windows and subwindows. The majority of operations can be

  controlled using the mouse for moving the pointer and the left

  mouse button for initiating and performing operations"
