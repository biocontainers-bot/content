Additionally, teaching that occurs in a clinically contextualized, case-based setting in real time has the potential to be more effective than traditional didactics. We piloted a teaching tool to enhance learning and engagement with the literature for fellows on the infectious diseases (ID) consult service. MethodsDuring a clinical service rotation, ID faculty posted a brief daily teaching point on Twitter under the hashtag “#IDDailyPearl” with a link to the relevant article. Tweets were required to be related to a patient case, associated with an article, and could not include patient identifiers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '2537 IDDailyPearl', 'teaching', 'ConclusionOur', 'engagement'",
