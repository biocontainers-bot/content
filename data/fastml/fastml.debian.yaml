summary: maximum likelihood ancestral amino-acid sequence reconstruction
description: >
  FastML is a bioinformatics tool for the reconstruction of ancestral
  sequences based on the phylogenetic relations between homologous
  sequences. FastML runs several algorithms that reconstruct the ancestral
  sequences with emphasis on an accurate reconstruction of both indels and
  characters. For character reconstruction the previously described FastML
  algorithms are used to efficiently infer the most likely ancestral
  sequences for each internal node of the tree. Both joint and the
  marginal reconstructions are provided. For indels reconstruction the
  sequences are first coded according to the indel events detected within
  the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and then a state-of-the-art
  likelihood model is used to reconstruct ancestral indels states. The
  results are the most probable sequences, together with posterior
  probabilities for each character and indel at each sequence position for
  each internal node of the tree. FastML is generic and is applicable for
  any type of molecular sequences (nucleotide, protein, or codon
  sequences).
