            "abstract": "MicroArray Gene expression and Network Evaluation Toolkit (MAGNET) is a web-based application that provides tools to generate and score both protein-protein interaction networks and coexpression networks. MAGNET integrates user-provided experimental measurements with high-throughput proteomic datasets, generating weighted gene-gene and protein-protein interaction networks. MAGNET allows users to weight edges of protein-protein interaction networks using a logistic regression model integrating tissue-specific gene expression data, sub-cellular localization data, co-clustering of interacting proteins and the number of observations of the interaction. This provides a way to quantitatively measure the plausibility of interactions in protein-protein interaction networks given protein/gene expression measurements. Secondly, MAGNET generates filtered coexpression networks, where genes are represented as nodes, and their correlations are represented with edges. Overall, MAGNET provides researchers with a new framework with which to analyze and generate gene-gene and protein-protein interaction networks, based on both the user's own data and publicly available-omics datasets.
