Many fundamental questions in evolutionary biology entail estimating rates of lineage diversification (speciation-extinction) that are modeled using birth-death branching processes. We leverage recent advances in branching-process theory to develop a flexible Bayesian framework for specifying diversification models - where rates are constant, vary continuously, or change episodically through time - and implement numerical methods to estimate parameters of these models from molecular phylogenies, even when species sampling is incomplete. We enable both statistical inference and efficient simulation under these models. We also provide robust methods for comparing the relative and absolute fit of competing branching-process models to a given tree, thereby providing rigorous tests of biological hypotheses regarding patterns and processes of lineage diversification.",

Speciation and extinction rates can be any function of time and mass-extinction events at specific times can be provided. Trees can be simulated either conditioned on the number of species, the time of the process, or both. Additionally, the likelihood equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.",
