This paper describes its functionality, implementation and examples of its use. The program can run as an Applet in a web browser allowing structures to be displayed without installing additional software. Applications of its use are described for visualisation and as part of a structure based design platform. The software is being made freely available to the community and may be downloaded from http://www.astex-technology.com/Astex Viewer.",
