description: MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of multiple assays performed
  on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a familiar Bioconductor user experience
  by extending concepts from SummarizedExperiment, supporting an open-ended mix of
  standard data classes for individual assays, and allowing subsetting by genomic
  ranges or rownames.
