summary: Software for integrating multi-omics experiments in BioConductor
description: >
  MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of
  multiple assays performed on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a
  familiar Bioconductor user experience by extending concepts from
  SummarizedExperiment, supporting an open-ended mix of standard data classes
  for individual assays, and allowing subsetting by genomic ranges or rownames.
