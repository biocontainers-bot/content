Scientists can, in a single place, rapidly identify biological annotation of a target, its structural characterization, expression levels and protein interaction data, as well as suitable cell lines for experiments, potential tool compounds and similarity to known drug targets. canSAR has, from the outset, been completely use-case driven which has dramatically influenced the design of the back-end and the functionality provided through the interfaces. The Web interface at http://cansar.icr.ac.uk provides flexible, multipoint entry into canSAR. This allows easy access to the multidisciplinary data within, including target and compound synopses, bioactivity views and expert tools for chemogenomic, expression and protein interaction network data.
