We here present an open-source Java application programming interface for mzTab called jmzTab. The software allows the efficient processing of mzTab files, providing read and write capabilities, and is designed to be embedded in other software packages. The second key feature of the jmzTab model is that it provides a flexible framework to maintain the logical integrity between the metadata and the table-based sections in the mzTab files. In this article, as two example implementations, we also describe two stand-alone tools that can be used to validate mzTab files and to convert PRIDE XML files to mzTab.
