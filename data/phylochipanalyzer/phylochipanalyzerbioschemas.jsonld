  "sc:description": "PhylochipAnalyzer is a Windows-program for the analysis of experiments with hierarchical probe-sets. It operates in two modes: first, the hierarchy of probes is defined interactively, second, the intensity data of a hybridized chip is loaded and analyzed according to the hierarchy. The program can export hierarchy trees to Newick-format and analyzed data to Excel. It contains a Delphi-script that makes it configurable with respect to different criteria for positive signals.",
