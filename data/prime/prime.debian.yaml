summary: bayesian estimation of gene trees taking the species tree into account
description: >
  PrIME (Probabilistic Integrated Models of Evolution) is a package
  supporting inference of evolutionary parameters in a Bayesian framework
  using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. A distinguishing feature of
  PrIME is that the species tree is taken into account when analyzing gene
  trees.
  .
  The input data to PrIME is a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format
  and the output data contains trees in Newick format.
version: 1.0.11
