            "abstract": "A cDNA microarray comprising 5184 different cDNAs spotted onto nylon membrane filters was developed for prostate gene expression studies. The clones used for arraying were identified by cluster analysis of >35 000 prostate cDNA library-derived expressed sequence tags (ESTs) present in the dbEST database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Total RNA from two cell lines, prostate line 8.4 and melanoma line UACC903, was used to make radiolabeled probe for filter hybridizations. The absolute intensity of each individual cDNA spot was determined by phosphorimager scanning and evaluated by a bioinformatics package developed specifically for analysis of cDNA microarray experimentation. Results indicated 89% of the genes showed intensity levels above background in prostate cells compared with only 28% in melanoma cells. Replicate probe preparations yielded results with correlation values ranging from r = 0.90 to 0.93 and coefficient of variation ranging from 16 to 28%. Findings indicate that among others, the keratin 5 and vimentin genes were differentially expressed between these two divergent cell lines. Follow-up northern blot analysis verified these two expression changes, thereby demonstrating the reliability of this system. We report the development of a cDNA microarray system that is sensitive and reliable, demonstrates a low degree of variability, and is capable of determining verifiable gene expression differences between two distinct human cell lines. This system will prove useful for differential gene expression analysis in prostate-derived cells and tissue. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",
