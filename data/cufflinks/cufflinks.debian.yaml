summary: Transcript assembly, differential expression and regulation for RNA-Seq
description: >
  Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for
  differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned
  RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of
  transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these
  transcripts based on how many reads support each one.
