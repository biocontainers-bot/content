biotools_id: flowmap
description: flowMap quantifies the similarity of cell populations across multiple
  flow cytometry samples using a nonparametric multivariate statistical test. The
  method is able to map cell populations of different size, shape, and proportion
  across multiple flow cytometry samples. The algorithm can be incorporate in any
  flow cytometry work flow that requires accurat quantification of similarity between
  cell populations.
