description: >
  The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several
  stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary
  structures. It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker
  in Vienna.
  .
  RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the
  most used function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic
  programming algorithms for structure prediction:
   * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which
     yields a single optimal structure, 
   * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates
     base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the
     suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates
     all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the optimal
     energy.
  .
  For secondary structure comparison, the package contains several
  measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
  tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an algorithm
  to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).
  The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
  and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
  Vienna RNA package.
