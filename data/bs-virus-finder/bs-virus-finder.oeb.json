Bisulfite sequencing studies mainly focus on calling single nucleotide polymorphism, different methylation region, and find allele-specific DNA methylation. Until now, only a few software tools have focused on virus integration using bisulfite sequencing data. Findings: We have developed a new and easy-to-use software tool, named BS-virus-finder (BSVF, RRID:SCR 015727), to detect viral integration breakpoints in whole human genomes. The tool is hosted at https://github.com/BGI-SZ/BSVF. Conclusions: BS-virus-finder demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity. It is useful in epigenetic studies and to reveal the relationship between viral integration and DNA methylation. BS-virus-finder is the first software tool to detect virus integration loci by using bisulfite sequencing data.",
