However, the translational regulation of oxidative stress response remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal a tRNA modification-mediated translational response to H2O2 in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrated that the P. aeruginosa trmB gene encodes a tRNA guanine (46)-N7-methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m7G46 in the tRNA variable loop. Twenty-three tRNA substrates of TrmB with a guanosine residue at position 46 were identified, including 11 novel tRNA substrates. We showed that loss of trmB had a strong negative effect on the translation of Phe- and Asp-enriched mRNAs",
