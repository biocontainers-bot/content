summary: structural variant and indel caller for mapped sequencing data
description: >
  Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end
  sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in
  small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample
  pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, medium-
  sized indels and large insertions within a single efficient workflow.
  The method is designed for rapid analysis on standard compute hardware:
  NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 minutes on a
  20 core server, and most WGS tumor/normal analyses can be completed
  within 2 hours. Manta combines paired and split-read evidence during SV
  discovery and scoring to improve accuracy, but does not require split-
  reads or successful breakpoint assemblies to report a variant in cases
  where there is strong evidence otherwise. It provides scoring models for
  germline variants in small sets of diploid samples and somatic variants
  in matched tumor/normal sample pairs. There is experimental support for
  analysis of unmatched tumor samples as well. Manta accepts input read
  mappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and indel inferences
  in VCF 4.1 format.
