summary: pythonic workflow management system
description: >
  Build systems like GNU Make are frequently used to create complicated
  workflows, e.g. in bioinformatics. This project aims to reduce the
  complexity of creating workflows by providing a clean and modern domain
  specific language (DSL) in Python style, together with a fast and
  comfortable execution environment.
