description: >
  BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
  a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
  three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
  algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
  the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
  and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
  alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
  for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
  also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
  reads.
