  "sc:description": "Provides gene function predictions for yeast and human by constructing a functional linkage network (FLN) from gene expression and molecular interaction data. It then labels genes in the FLN with their annotations from Gene Ontology, and systematically propagates these labels across the FLN in order to predict the functions of unlabelled genes.",
