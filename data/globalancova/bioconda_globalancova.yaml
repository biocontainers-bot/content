description: 'The association between a variable of interest (e.g. two groups) and
  the global pattern of a group of variables (e.g. a gene set) is tested via a global
  F-test. We give the following arguments in support of the GlobalAncova approach:
  After appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather symmetrical
  and outliers are no real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA
  with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group
  and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias.
  Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application
  of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken).
  Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The
  test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination
  with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated.
  Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values. The framework is generalized
  to groups of categorical variables or even mixed data by a likelihood ratio approach.
  Closed and hierarchical testing procedures are supported. This work was supported
  by the NGFN grant 01 GR 0459, BMBF, Germany and BMBF grant 01ZX1309B, Germany.'
