It operates on genomic regions, annotated chromosomal intervals that represent sequencing short reads, gene locations, ChIP-seq peaks or other genomic features. Applications of GROK include file format conversions, set operations, overlap queries, and filtering and transformation operations. Supported file formats include BAM/SAM, BED, BedGraph, CSV, FASTQ, GFF/GTF, VCF and Wiggle.",
