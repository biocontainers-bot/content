            "abstract": "Prediction of transmembrane β-strands in outer membrane proteins (OMP) is one of the important problems in computational chemistry and biology. In this work, we propose a method based on neural networks for identifying the membrane-spanning β-strands. We introduce the concept of \"residue probability\" for assigning residues in transmembrane β-strand segments. The performance of our method is evaluated with single-residue accuracy, correlation, specificity, and sensitivity. Our predicted segments show a good agreement with experimental observations with an accuracy level of 73% solely from amino acid sequence information. Further, the predictive power of N- and C-terminal residues in each segments, number of segments in each protein, and the influence of cutoff probability for identifying membrane-spanning β-strands will be discussed. We have developed a Web server for predicting the transmembrane β-strands from the amino acid sequence, and the prediction results are available at http://psfs.cbrc.jp/tmbeta-net/. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The amino acid compositions of globular and outer membrane proteins have been systematically analyzed and a statistical method has been proposed for discriminating outer membrane proteins. The prediction of membrane spanning segments is mainly based on feed forward neural network and refined with β-strand length. Our program takes the amino acid sequence as input and displays the type of the protein along with membrane-spanning β-strand segments as a stretch of highlighted amino acid residues. Further, the probability of residues to be in transmembrane β-strand has been provided with a coloring scheme. We observed that outer membrane proteins were discriminated with an accuracy of 89% and their membrane spanning β-strand segments at an accuracy of 73% just from amino acid sequence information.
