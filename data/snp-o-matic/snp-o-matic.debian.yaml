summary: fast, stringent short-read mapping software
description: >
  High throughput sequencing technologies generate large amounts of short reads.
  Mapping these to a reference sequence consumes large amounts of processing
  time and memory, and read mapping errors can lead to noisy or incorrect
  alignments.
  .
  SNP-o-matic is a fast, stringent short-read mapping software. It supports a
  multitude of output types and formats, for uses in filtering reads, alignments,
  sequence-based genotyping calls, assisted reassembly of contigs etc.
