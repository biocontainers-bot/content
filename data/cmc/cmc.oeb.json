            "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-23 nt) RNAs that are sequence-specific mediators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals. Â© 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",
