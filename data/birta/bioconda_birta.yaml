description: Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by different processes,
  comprising inhibition or activation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional
  degradation by microRNAs. birta (Bayesian Inference of Regulation of Transcriptional
  Activity) uses the regulatory networks of TFs and miRNAs together with mRNA and
  miRNA expression data to predict switches in regulatory activity between two conditions.
  A Bayesian network is used to model the regulatory structure and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
  is applied to sample the activity states.
