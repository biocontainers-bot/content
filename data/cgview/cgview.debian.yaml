summary: Circular Genome Viewer
description: >
  CGView is a Java package for generating high quality, zoomable maps of
  circular genomes. Its primary purpose is to serve as a component of
  sequence annotation pipelines, as a means of generating visual output
  suitable for the web. Feature information and rendering options are
  supplied to the program using an XML file, a tab delimited file, or an
  NCBI ptt file. CGView converts the input into a graphical map (PNG, JPG,
  or Scalable Vector Graphics format), complete with labels, a title,
  legends, and footnotes. In addition to the default full view map, the
  program can generate a series of hyperlinked maps showing expanded
  views. The linked maps can be explored using any web browser, allowing
  rapid genome browsing, and facilitating data sharing. The feature labels
  in maps can be hyperlinked to external resources, allowing CGView maps
  to be integrated with existing web site content or databases.
  .
  In addition to the CGView application, an API is available for
  generating maps from within other Java applications, using the
  cgview package.
  .
  CGView can be used for any of the following:
   * Bacterial genome visualization and browsing - CGView can be
     incorporated into bacterial genome annotation pipelines, as a means
     of generating web content for data visualization and navigation. The
     PNG and image map content does not require Java applets or special
     browser plugins.
   * Genome poster generation - CGView can generate poster-sized images of
     circular genomes in rasterized image formats or in Scalable Vector
     Graphics format.
   * Sequence analysis visualization - CGView can be used to display the
     output of sequence analysis programs in a circular context.
  .
  CGView features:
   * Images can be generated in PNG, JPG, or SVG format. See the
     CGView gallery.
   * Static or interactive maps can be generated. The interactive maps
     make use of standard PNG images and HTML image maps. Scalable Vector
     Graphics output is included in the interactive maps (see example).
   * The XML input allows complete control over the appearance of the map.
   * Tab delimited input files and NCBI ptt files can be used as an
     alternative to the XML format.
   * The CGView API can be used to incorporate CGView into Java
     applications.
   * The CGView applet can be used to incorporate zoomable maps into web
     pages (see example).
   * The CGView Server can be used to generate maps online.
