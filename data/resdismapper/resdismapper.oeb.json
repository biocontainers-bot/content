        "description": "An R package for fine-scale mapping of resistance to dispersal.\n\nManagement of biological invasions and conservation activity in the fight against habitat fragmentation both require information on how ongoing dispersal of organisms is affected by the environment. However, there are few landscape genetic programs that map resistance to dispersal at small spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate such analyses, we present an R package named ResDisMapper for the mapping of resistance to dispersal at small spatiotemporal scales, without the need for prior knowledge on environmental features or intensive computation. Based on the concept of isolation by distance (IBD), ResDisMapper calculates resistance using deviations of each pair of samples from the general IBD trend (IBD residuals). The IBD residuals are projected onto the studied area, which allows construction and visualization of a fine-scale map of resistance based on spatial accumulation of positive or negative IBD residuals",
