Genome Surveyor was developed as a tool for predicting transcription factor (TF) binding targets and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs/enhancers), based on motifs representing experimentally determined DNA binding specificities. Since its first publication, we have added substantial new functionality (e.g. phylogenetic averaging of motif scores from multiple species, and a novel CRM discovery technique), increased the number of supported motifs about 4-fold (from ∼100 to ∼400), added provisions for evolutionary comparison across many more Drosophila species (from 2 to 12), and improved the user-interface. The server is free and open to all users, and there is no login requirement. Address: http://veda.cs.uiuc.edu/gs. © 2011 The Author(s).",
