Whether the samples are heterozygous, haploid or a combination of the two, they can be compared with two up-to-date databases of all known alleles of several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) loci. The results of the submission are returned as a table of potential allele hits, along with the respective base changes and an interactive sequence viewer for close examination of the alignment.
