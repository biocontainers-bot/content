            "abstract": "Inferring protein abundances from peptide intensities is the key step in quantitative proteomics. The inference is necessarily more accurate when many peptides are taken into account for a given protein. Yet, the information brought by the peptides shared by different proteins is commonly discarded. We propose a statistical framework based on a hierarchical modeling to include that information. Our methodology, based on a simultaneous analysis of all the quantified peptides, handles the biological and technical errors as well as the peptide effect. In addition, we propose a practical implementation suitable for analyzing large data sets. Compared to a method based on the analysis of one protein at a time (that does not include shared peptides), our methodology proved to be far more reliable for estimating protein abundances and testing abundance changes.
