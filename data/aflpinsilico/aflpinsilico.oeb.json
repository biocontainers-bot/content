It allows identification of the fragments and the genes they are tagging, sparing the collection and sequencing task. Besides data analysis, such simulations can be used by experimentalists to efficiently plan and design AFLP based experiments, saving time and expensive trials.",

The AFLPinSilico application presented here simulates AFLP experiments run on either cDNA or genomic sequences, producing virtual fingerprints that allow high throughput identification of AFLP fragments. The program also enables biologists to manage experiments through simulations done beforehand, thereby reducing the number of experiments that have to be run. AFLPinSilico is available through the www or as a stand-alone version, through a command line executable (available upon request, for any platform running PERL).",
