It is capable of reproducing many structure-specific properties of protein sequence evolution, most notably spatial and temporal variation in rates, and has been used to investigate several hypotheses about the influence of thermodynamics on molecular evolution. The software is implemented in object-oriented C++, is supported on Linux, and the source code is made freely available under the GPL v3 license at http://www.wyomingbioinformatics.org/Liberle sGroup/CASS/.
