description: 'SINA allows incorporating additional sequences into an existing

  multiple sequence alignment (MSA) without modifying the original

  alignment. While adding sequences to an MSA with SINA is usually

  faster than re-computing the entire MSA from an augmented set of

  unaligned sequences, the primary benefit lies in protecting

  investments made into the original MSA such as manual curation of the

  alignment, compute intensive phylogenetic tree reconstruction and

  taxonomic annotation of the resulting phylogeny.


  Additionally, SINA includes a homology search which uses the

  previously computed alignment to determine the most similar

  sequences. Based on the search results, a LCA based classification of

  the query sequence can be computed using taxonomic classifications

  assigned to the sequences comprising the reference MSA.


  SINA is used to compute the small and large subunit ribosomal RNA

  alignments provided by the SILVA_ project and is able to use the ARB_

  format reference databases released by the project.
