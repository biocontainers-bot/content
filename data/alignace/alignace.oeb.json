By searching for mutually similar DNA elements among the upstream non-coding DNA sequences of these genes, we can identify candidate regulatory motifs and corresponding candidate sets of coregulated genes. We have tested this strategy by applying it to three extensively studied regulatory systems in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: galactose response, heat shock, and mating type. Galactose- response data yielded the known binding site of Ga14, and six of nine genes known to be induced by galactose. Heat shock data yielded the cell-cycle activation motif, which is known to mediate cell-cycle dependent activation, and a set of genes coding for all four nucleosomal proteins. Mating type α and a data yielded all of the four relevant DNA motifs and most of the known a- and α-specific genes.",
