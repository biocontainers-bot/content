summary: selection of best-fit models of protein evolution
description: >
  PROTTEST (ModelTest's relative) is a program for selecting the model of
  protein evolution that best fits a given set of sequences (alignment).
  This java program is based on the Phyml program (for maximum likelihood
  calculations and optimization of parameters) and uses the PAL library as
  well. Models included are empirical substitution matrices (such as WAG,
  LG, mtREV, Dayhoff, DCMut, JTT, VT, Blosum62, CpREV, RtREV, MtMam,
  MtArt, HIVb, and HIVw) that indicate relative rates of amino acid
  replacement, and specific improvements (+I:invariable sites, +G: rate
  heterogeneity among sites, +F: observed amino acid frequencies) to
  account for the evolutionary constraints impossed by conservation of
  protein structure and function. ProtTest uses the Akaike Information
  Criterion (AIC) and other statistics (AICc and BIC) to find which of the
  candidate models best fits the data at hand.
