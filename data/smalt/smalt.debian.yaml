summary: Sequence Mapping and Alignment Tool
description: >
  SMALT efficiently aligns DNA sequencing reads with a reference genome.
  Reads from a wide range of sequencing platforms, for example Illumina,
  Roche-454, Ion Torrent, PacBio or ABI-Sanger, can be processed including
  paired reads.
  .
  The software employs a perfect hash index of short words (< 20
  nucleotides long), sampled at equidistant steps along the genomic
  reference sequences.
  .
  For each read, potentially matching segments in the reference are
  identified from seed matches in the index and subsequently aligned with
  the read using a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm.
  .
  The best gapped alignments of each read is reported including a score
  for the reliability of the best mapping. The user can adjust the
  trade-off between sensitivity and speed by tuning the length and spacing
  of the hashed words.
  .
  A mode for the detection of split (chimeric) reads is provided.
  Multi-threaded program execution is supported.
