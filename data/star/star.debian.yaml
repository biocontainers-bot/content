summary: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner
description: >
  Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a
  previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential
  maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by
  seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners
  by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
  million 2 Ã— 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server,
  while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In
  addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
  discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
  also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
  sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons,
  the authors experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice
  junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision
  of the STAR mapping strategy.
