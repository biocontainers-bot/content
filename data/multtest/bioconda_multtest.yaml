description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing
  procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling the family-wise error
  rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the
  proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR).  Several
  choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented (centered, centered
  and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available.
  Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on
  regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as those based on
  correlation parameters) are included.  When probing hypotheses with t-statistics,
  users may also select a potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate
  normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence
  function.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions
  and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to identifying
  differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
