summary: annotating protein coding genes in genomes.
description: >
  Genomic DNA controls the behaviour of biological cells. Understanding it, 
  and its variations, facilitates the molecular pathology of diseases. 
  braker.pl can either run with a genome sequence, only; or with additional 
  alignments for short transcriptome reads against the genome; or with 
  additional protein sequences of closely related species; or with evidence 
  from the alignment of protein sequences of distantly related species.
  The package provides the means to interpret genomic sequences in FASTA format
  from fungi, plants and animals.
