This paper presents a time-efficient algorithm that produces k best \"non-intersecting\" local alignments for any chosen k. The algorithm's main strength is that it needs only O(M + N + K) space, where M and N are the lengths of the given sequences and K is the total length of the computed alignments. Â© 1991.",
