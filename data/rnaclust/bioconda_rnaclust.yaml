description: 'RNAclust is a perl script summarizing all the single steps required
  for

  clustering of structured RNA motifs, i.e. identifying groups of RNA

  sequences sharing a secondary structure motif. It requires as input a

  multiple FASTA file. In the first step for each input sequence the base

  pair probability matrix of its secondary structure distribution is

  calculated (using RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package). Secondly, for

  each pair of base pair probability matrices a sequence-structure alignment

  is calculated using LocARNA. Lastly, a hierarchical cluster-tree (in

  NEWICK format) is derived by WPGMA clustering of the pairwise alignment

  distances and the optimal number of clusters is calculated from the tree.
