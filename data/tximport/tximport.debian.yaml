summary: transcript-level estimates for biological sequencing
description: >
  Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and
  transcript lengths, and summarizes into matrices for use with
  downstream gene-level analysis packages. Average transcript
  length, weighted by sample-specific transcript abundance
  estimates, is provided as a matrix which can be used as an
  offset for different expression of gene-level counts.
