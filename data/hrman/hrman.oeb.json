We present here an accurate and unbiased quantification method for host–pathogen interactions. We describe how to plan experiments and prepare, stain and image infected specimens and analyze them with the program HRMAn (Host Response to Microbe Analysis). HRMAn is a high-content image analysis method based on KNIME Analytics Platform. Users of this guide will be able to perform infection studies in high-throughput volume and to a greater level of detail. Relying on cutting edge machine learning algorithms, HRMAn can be trained and tailored to many experimental settings and questions.",
