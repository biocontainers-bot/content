summary: "miRTrace is a new quality control and taxonomic tracing tool developed specifically\
  \ for small RNA sequencing data (sRNA-Seq). \nEach sample is characterized by profiling\
  \ sequencing quality, read length, sequencing depth and miRNA complexity and also\
  \ the \namounts of miRNAs versus undesirable sequences (derived from tRNAs, rRNAs\
  \ and sequencing artifacts). In addition to these routine \nquality control (QC)\
  \ analyses, miRTrace can accurately and sensitively resolve taxonomic origins of\
  \ small RNA-Seq data based on the \ncomposition of clade-specific miRNAs. This feature\
  \ can be used to detect cross-clade contaminations in typical lab settings. It can\
  \ \nalso be applied for more specific applications in forensics, food quality control\
  \ and clinical diagnosis, for instance tracing the \norigins of meat products or\
  \ detecting parasitic microRNAs in host serum.\n"
