summary: automated reference-based bacterial RNA-seq Transcriptome Analysis
description: >
  SPARTA is a workflow aimed at analyzing single-end Illumina RNA-seq
  data. The workflow combines several tools: Trimmomatic (read
  trimming/adapter removal), FastQC (read quality analysis), Bowtie
  (mapping reads to the reference genome), HTSeq (transcript/gene feature
  abundance counting), and edgeR (differential gene expression analysis).
  Within the differential gene expression analysis step, batch effects can
  be detected and the user is warned of the potential, unintended
  additional variable. The analysis procedure is outlined below.
