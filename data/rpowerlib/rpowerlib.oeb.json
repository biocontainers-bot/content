Muller and colleagues. At present, the rPowerlib package DOES NOT include the full functionality of POWERLIB. For features such as power confidence intervals and more statistical tests, please try POWERLIB (http://github.com/samplesizeshop/powerlib) or GLIMMPSE (https://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org). Please visit http://SampleSizeShop.org for more information about calculating power and sample size",
