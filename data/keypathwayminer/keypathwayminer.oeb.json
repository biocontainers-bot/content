KeyPathwayMiner is a software platform designed to fill this gap by integrating previous knowledge captured in molecular interaction networks with OMICS datasets (DNA microarrays, RNA sequencing, genome-wide methylation studies, etc.) to extract connected subnetworks with a high number of deregulated genes. This protocol describes how to use KeyPathwayMiner for integrated analysis of multi-omics datasets in the network analysis tool Cytoscape and in a stand-alone web application available at https://keypathwayminer.compbio.sdu.dk.",
