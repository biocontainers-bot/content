In this paper, we solve the open problem, giving a practical, deterministic linear-time algorithm based on a simple data structure and simple operations on it. The method is straightforward to program and has been fully implemented. Simulations show that it is much faster in practice than prior nonlinear methods. The value of a linear-time solution to the PPH problem is partly conceptual and partly for use in the inner loop of algorithms for more complex problems, where the PPH problem must be solved repeatedly.

Hence it determines for SNP genotype data what the three or four gametes test (depending on whether the tree is rooted or not) determines for haplotype data.",
