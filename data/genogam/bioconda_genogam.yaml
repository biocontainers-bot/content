description: This package allows statistical analysis of genome-wide data with smooth
  functions using generalized additive models based on the implementation from the
  R-package 'mgcv'. It provides methods for the statistical analysis of ChIP-Seq data
  including inference of protein occupancy, and pointwise and region-wise differential
  analysis. Estimation of dispersion and smoothing parameters is performed by cross-validation.
  Scaling of generalized additive model fitting to whole chromosomes is achieved by
  parallelization over overlapping genomic intervals.
