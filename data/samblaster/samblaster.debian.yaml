summary: marks duplicates, extracts discordant/split reads
description: >
  Current "next-generation" sequencing technologies cannot tell what
  exact sequence they will be reading. They take what is available. And
  if some sequences are read very often, then this needs some extra
  biomedical thinking. The genome could for instance be duplicated.
  .
  samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in
  read-id grouped paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally output
  discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files,
  and/or unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking
  duplicates, samblaster will require approximately 20MB of memory per
  1M read pairs.
