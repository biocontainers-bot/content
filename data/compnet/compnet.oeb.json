        "description": "a GUI based tool for comparison of multiple biological interaction networks.\n\nInteraction networks are a convenient way of representing the complex nature of multi-component systems. Examples of such complex systems include biological pathways, social interactions, financial markets, management systems, multiple modules in a programming language, etc. Recognizing the similarities and differences between multiple interaction networks becomes easier when aided by proper visualization tools. we present a GUI based network comparison tool CompNet, which allows to visually compare multiple networks based on node and edge similarities. Additionally, the tool can compare individual networks on the basis of general network properties, node neighborhoods and community similarities. CompNet is expected to be a valuable addition in the field of visual data mining especially for users aiming to visually compare more than two interaction networks at the same time",
