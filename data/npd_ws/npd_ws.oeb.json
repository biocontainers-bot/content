A key characteristic of proteins, which can begin to elucidate their possible functions, is their subcellular location. A number of experimental approaches can reveal the subcellular localization of proteins in mammalian cells. However, genome databases now contain predicted sequences for a large number of potentially novel proteins that have yet to be studied in any way, let alone have their subcellular localization determined. Here we ask whether using bioinformatics tools to analyse the sequence of proteins whose subnuclear localizations have been determined can reveal characteristics or signatures that might allow us to predict localization for novel protein sequences.",
