      "sc:description": "DiversityDescriptions (DWB-DD) is an application of the Diversity Workbench (DWB). It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. DD has a generic database model. It is organising descriptions of organisms, taxa, syntaxa and any item, which is object of diversity research. The descriptions are characterized by a triple structure, namely ’item-descriptor-state’.  The states can be generalized to one of the presently supported data types (categorical states, quantitative values and measures, molecular sequence data and free-form text). The descriptors (=properties) are not limited to morphological characters and functional traits, but could be physiological, ecological, behavioral , survey parameters, molecular descriptors, descriptors of a lab workflow, descriptors of data content schemes. Sample data and measurement data as gained by ecological field sampling are addressed with own functions.",
