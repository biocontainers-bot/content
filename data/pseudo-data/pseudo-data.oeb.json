However, this usually requires the availability of the original data and in many cases only summary data are available in the publications. Here the generation of pseudo-data under certain assumptions using extension packages in the open-source project R on statistical computing is shown. Several case studies are used to illustrate the applicability in regulatory toxicology.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'toxicological', 'bioassays', 're-evaluation', 'open-source'",
