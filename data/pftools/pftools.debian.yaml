summary: build and search protein and DNA generalized profiles
description: >
  The pftools package contains all the software necessary to build protein
  and DNA generalized profiles and use them to scan and align sequences,
  and search databases.
  .
  File formats used by the pftools
   * Generalized profiles format and syntax.
   * The multiple sequence alignment format (PSA).
   * The extended header multiple sequence alignment format (XPSA).
  .
  Programs to build generalized profiles
   pfmake
     Build a profile from a multiple sequence alignment.
   pfscale
     Fit parameters of an extreme-value distribution to a profile score list.
   pfw
     Weight sequences of a multiple sequence alignment to correct for
     sampling bias.
  .
  Programs to search with generalized profiles
   pfsearch / pfsearchV3
     Search a protein or DNA sequence library for sequence segments matching
     a profile (V3 is the new version of this tool).
   pfscan
     Scan a protein or DNA sequence with a profile library
  .
  Conversion programs
   psa2msa
     Reformat PSA file to Pearson/Fasta multiple sequence alignment file.
   ptof
     Convert a protein profile into a frame-search profile to search DNA
     sequences. To be used with 2ft.
   2ft
     Converts both strands of DNA into so-called interleaved
     frame-translated DNA sequences to search with protein profiles. To be
     used with ptof.
   6ft
     Translates all six reading frames of a double-stranded DNA sequence
     into individual protein sequences.
   pfgtop
     Convert a profile in GCG format into PROSITE format.
   pfhtop
     Convert a HMMER1 ASCII-formatted HMM into an equivalent PROSITE profile.
   ptoh
     Converts a generalized profile into an approximately equivalent HMM
     profile in HMMER1 format (can be read by the hmmconvert program from
     the HMMER2 package).
