  "sc:description": "An interactive graphical software package which can be used to quantitate isotopologues for a wide variety of metabolites detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It performs targeted automated metabolite identification, isotopologue mass and abundance determination and natural isotope abundance correction.\nAs it is designed to detect metabolites irrespective of the extent of isotopic labelling, this software may also be used to perform targeted analysis on unlabelled data sets.",
