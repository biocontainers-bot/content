summary: produces PostScript graphical output from GFF-files
description: >
  gff2ps is a script program developed with the aim of converting gff-formatted
  records into high quality one-dimensional plots in PostScript. Such plots
  maybe useful for comparing genomic structures and to visualizing outputs from
  genome annotation programs.
  It can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the GFF file
  itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows through a
  number of options and/or a configuration file, for a great degree of
  customization.
