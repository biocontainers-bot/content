description: Label propagation approaches are a widely used procedure in computational
  biology for giving context to molecular entities using network data. Node labels,
  which can derive from gene expression, genome-wide association studies, protein
  domains or metabolomics profiling, are propagated to their neighbours in the network,
  effectively smoothing the scores through prior annotated knowledge and prioritising
  novel candidates. The R package diffuStats contains a collection of diffusion kernels
  and scoring approaches that facilitates their computation and benchmarking.
