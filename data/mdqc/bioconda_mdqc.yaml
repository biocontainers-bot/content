description: MDQC is a multivariate quality assessment method for microarrays based
  on quality control (QC) reports. The Mahalanobis distance of an array's quality
  attributes is used to measure the similarity of the quality of that array against
  the quality of the other arrays. Then, arrays with unusually high distances can
  be flagged as potentially low-quality.
