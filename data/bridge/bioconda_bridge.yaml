description: Test for differentially expressed genes with microarray data. This package
  can be used with both cDNA microarrays or Affymetrix chip. The packge fits a robust
  Bayesian hierarchical model for testing for differential expression. Outliers are
  modeled explicitly using a $t$-distribution. The model includes an exchangeable
  prior for the variances which allow different variances for the genes but still
  shrink extreme empirical variances. Our model can be used for testing for differentially
  expressed genes among multiple samples, and can distinguish between the different
  possible patterns of differential expression when there are three or more samples.
  Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass on subspaces of the full parameter
  space.
