summary: GNU R package for genetic marker linkage analysis
description: >
  R/qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for mapping quantitative
  trait loci (QTLs) in experimental crosses. It is implemented as an
  add-on-package for the freely available and widely used statistical
  language/software R (see http://www.r-project.org).
  .
  The development of this software as an add-on to R allows one to take
  advantage of the basic mathematical and statistical functions, and
  powerful graphics capabilities, that are provided with R. Further,
  the user will benefit by the seamless integration of the QTL mapping
  software into a general statistical analysis program. The goal is to
  make complex QTL mapping methods widely accessible and allow users to
  focus on modeling rather than computing.
  .
  A key component of computational methods for QTL mapping is the hidden
  Markov model (HMM) technology for dealing with missing genotype data. The
  main HMM algorithms, with allowance for the presence of genotyping errors,
  for backcrosses, intercrosses, and phase-known four-way crosses
  were implemented.
  .
  The current version of R/qtl includes facilities for estimating
  genetic maps, identifying genotyping errors, and performing single-QTL
  genome scans and two-QTL, two-dimensional genome scans, by interval
  mapping (with the EM algorithm), Haley-Knott regression, and multiple
  imputation. All of this may be done in the presence of covariates (such
  as sex, age or treatment). One may also fit higher-order QTL models by
  multiple imputation.
