  "sc:description": "The Functional Annotation Of the Mammalian Genome is a database for the transcriptional network that regulates macrophage differentiation. Data comes from cap analysis of gene expression, sequencing mRNA 5-ends with a second-generation sequencer to quantify promoter activities even in the absence of gene annotation. Additional genome-wide experiments complement the setup including short RNA sequencing, microarray gene expression profiling on large-scale perturbation experiments.",
