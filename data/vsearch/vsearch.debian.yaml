summary: tool for processing metagenomic sequences
description: >
  Versatile 64-bit multithreaded tool for processing metagenomic sequences,
  including searching, clustering, chimera detection, dereplication, sorting,
  masking and shuffling
  .
  The aim of this project is to create an alternative to the USEARCH tool
  developed by Robert C. Edgar (2010). The new tool should:
  .
   - have a 64-bit design that handles very large databases and much more
     than 4GB of memory
   - be as accurate or more accurate than usearch
   - be as fast or faster than usearch
version: 2.14.1
