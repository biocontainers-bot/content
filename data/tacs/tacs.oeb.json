            "abstract": "Â© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Comprehensively understanding the dynamics of biological systems is among the biggest current challenges in biology and medicine. To acquire this understanding, researchers have measured the time-series expression profiles of cell lines of various organisms. Biological technologies have also drastically improved, providing a huge amount of information with support from bioinformatics and systems biology. However, the transitions between the activation and inactivation of gene regulations, at the temporal resolution of single time points, are difficult to extract from time-course gene expression profiles. Results: Our proposed method reports the activation period of each gene regulation from gene expression profiles and a gene regulatory network. The correctness and effectiveness of the method were validated by analyzing the diauxic shift from glucose to lactose in Escherichia coli. The method completely detected the three periods of the shift; 1) consumption of glucose as nutrient source, 2) the period of seeking another nutrient source and 3) consumption of lactose as nutrient source. We then applied the method to mouse adipocyte differentiation data. Cell differentiation into adipocytes is known to involve two waves of the gene regulation cascade, and sub-waves are predicted. From the gene expression profiles of the cell differentiation process from ES to adipose cells (62 time points), our method acquired four periods; three periods covering the two known waves of the cascade, and a final period of gene regulations when the differentiation to adipocytes was completed. Conclusions: Our proposed method identifies the transitions of gene regulations from time-series gene expression profiles. Dynamic analyses are essential for deep understanding of biological systems and for identifying the causes of the onset of diseases such as diabetes and osteoporosis. The proposed method can greatly contribute to the progress of biology and medicine.",
