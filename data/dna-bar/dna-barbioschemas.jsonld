  "sc:description": "DNA-BAR is a software package for selecting DNA probes (henceforth referred to as distinguishers) that can be used in genomic-based identification of microorganisms. Given the genomic sequences of the microorganisms, DNA-BAR finds a near-minimum number of distinguishers yielding a distinct hybridization pattern for each microorganism. Selected distinguishers satisfy user specified bounds on length, melting temperature and GC content, as well as redundancy and cross-hybridization constraints.",
