The program allows a rapid identification of the most polymorphic enzymes, creates a collection of T-RFs for the data set, and can potentially identify specific T-RFs in T-RF length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns by comparing theoretical and experimental results. TRiFLE was used for analyzing T-RFLP data generated for the amoA and pmoA genes. The peaks identified in the T-RFLP patterns show an overlap of ammonia- and methane-oxidizing bacteria in the metalimnion of a subtropical lake. Copyright Â© 2008, American Society for Microbiology.
