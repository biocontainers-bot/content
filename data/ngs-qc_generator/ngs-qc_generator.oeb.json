            "abstract": "© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.The combination of massive parallel sequencing with a variety of modern DNA/RNA enrichment technologies provides means for interrogating functional protein–genome interactions (ChIP-seq), genome-wide transcriptional activity (RNA-seq; GRO-seq), chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq, MNase-seq), and more recently the three-dimensional organization of chromatin (Hi-C, ChIA-PET). In systems biology-based approaches several of these readouts are generally cumulated with the aim of describing living systems through a reconstitution of the genome-regulatory functions. However, an issue that is often underestimated is that conclusions drawn from such multidimensional analyses of NGS-derived datasets critically depend on the quality of the compared datasets. To address this problem, we have developed the NGS-QC Generator, a quality control system that infers quality descriptors for any kind of ChIP-sequencing and related datasets. In this chapter we provide a detailed protocol for (1) assessing quality descriptors with the NGS-QC Generator; (2) to interpret the generated reports; and (3) to explore the database of QC indicators (www.ngs-qc.org) for >21,000 publicly available datasets.",

The Galaxy tool NGS-QC Generator is a computational-based approach that infers quality indicators from the distribution of sequenced reads associated to a particular NGS profile. Such information is then used for comparative purposes and for defining strategies to improve the quality of sample-derived datasets.",
