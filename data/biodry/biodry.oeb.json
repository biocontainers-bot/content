This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The R-package BIOdry allows to model and compare fluctuations of Tree-ring Width (TRW) and climate, or dendroclimatic fluctuations, while accounting for source variability. The package eases multilevel modeling and multivariate comparison in dendroclimatic analysis using the nlme and ecodist packages, respectively. For implementing such libraries, the in-package algorithms transform the dendroclimatic fluctuations into Multilevel Dendroclimatic Data Series and maintain categorical variables and time units in the outputs. The dendroclimatic modeling is developed with two functions: modelFrame and muleMan. The first function binds core-level cumulative TRWs to the processed data sets and subtracts trends in TRWs by fitting multilevel log-linear growth formulas or multilevel linear formulas. modelFrame can also model within-group fluctuations in dendroclimatic variables other than tree-radial increments such as aridity indices or allometric components of tree growth: e.g. diameters at breast height over bark, tree basal areas, total tree biomass, among other. The second function compares fluctuations in modelFrame objects that share outermost categorical variable and annual records. Here, we use BIOdry to model dendroclimatic relationships in northern and east-central Spain to illustrate future users in the implementation of the package for modeling ecological relationships in space and time.",
