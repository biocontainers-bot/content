summary: single molecule sequence assembler for genomes
description: >
  Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise
  single-molecule sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II or Oxford
  Nanopore MinION).
  .
  Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:
  .
   * Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using MHAP
   * Generate corrected sequence consensus
   * Trim corrected sequences
   * Assemble trimmed corrected sequences
version: 1.9
