description: 'Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the comparison
  of two biological conditions (treated vs. untreated, diseased vs. normal, mutant
  vs. wild-type) among different levels of gene expression (transcriptome ,translatome,
  proteome), using several statistical methods: Rank Product, Translational Efficiency,
  t-test, Limma, ANOTA, DESeq, edgeR. Possibility to plot the results with scatterplots,
  histograms, MA plots, standard deviation (SD) plots, coefficient of variation (CV)
  plots. Detection of significantly enriched post-transcriptional regulatory factors
  (RBPs, miRNAs, etc) and Gene Ontology terms in the lists of DEGs previously identified
  for the two expression levels. Comparison of GO terms enriched only in one of the
  levels or in both. Calculation of the semantic similarity score between the lists
  of enriched GO terms coming from the two expression levels. Visual examination and
  comparison of the enriched terms with heatmaps, radar plots and barplots.'
