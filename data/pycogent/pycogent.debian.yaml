summary: framework for genomic biology
description: >
  PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully
  integrated and thoroughly tested framework for:
   * controlling third-party applications,
   * devising workflows; querying databases,
   * conducting novel probabilistic analyses of biological sequence
     evolution, and
   * generating publication quality graphics.
  It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities (such as true codon
  alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods for the analysis
  of genomic data.
version: 1.9
