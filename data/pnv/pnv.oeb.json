Errors and artifacts are still possible. Training data sets BIOME 6000 and EU Forest are constantly being updated and could still contain erroneously geolocated points. Predictions of FAPAR are based on randomly simulated points and not on ground observations of FAPAR and classification of sites. Predictions of EU forest tree species are presented for experimental purposes only. To report an issue or artifact in maps, please use https://github.com/envirometrix/PNVmaps/issues.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CHELSA', 'land', 'Global mapping potential natural vegetation', 'forest'",
