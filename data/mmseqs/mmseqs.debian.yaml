summary: ultra fast and sensitive protein search and clustering
description: >
  MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite to
  search and cluster huge proteins/nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2 is
  open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS,
  and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to
  run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.
  MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it
  achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile searches
  with the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.
