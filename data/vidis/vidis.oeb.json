        "description": "A Platform for Constructing and Sharing of Medical Algorithms.\n\nThe literature and the Internet provide different sources, in which medical community as well as patients can browse through medical algorithms. These algorithms are dispersed and use different formats of presentation. We present visualized diagnosis (ViDis), a web platform aimed to construction and sharing of graphical representations of medical algorithms in a single place and in a unified format. ViDis is accessible as a web application, which can run on an arbitrary platform with a modern web browser. The platform's user friendly interfaces allow the users with different backgrounds to construct, share, and browse through medical algorithms. Visualization of the algorithms can be created using a flowchart diagram notation that is commonly applied in the design of computer software and is very intuitive to use and understand.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
