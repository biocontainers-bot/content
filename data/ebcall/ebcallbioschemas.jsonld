  "sc:description": "EBCall is a software package for somatic mutation detection (including InDels). EBCall uses not only paired tumor/normal sequence data of a target sample, but also multiple non-paired normal reference samples for evaluating distribution of sequencing errors, which leads to an accurate mutaiton detection even in case of low sequencing depths and low allele frequencies.",
