summary: RNA-seq expression estimation
description: >
  RNA-seq is a technology to read at least parts of individual RNA
  sequences of a tissue sample. After assigning these reads to genes
  that are likely responsible to have coded for them (mapping), this
  gives an insight (estimate) about how much these genes have been
  active (expressed) in that sample. The trickier bits in that process
  to address is the similarity of genes and the genes being capable to
  variably but deterministically skip parts of their sequence to be read
  (introns). A single variantly spliced gene may then yield different
  sequences (isoforms) and the RNA-seq evaluation better informs about
  this. It may be relevant for a disease.
  .
  Sailfish is particularly good (efficient) in this process. It tricks
  the complexity by introducing an intermediate level of artificial very
  short reads to which the alternative splicing is of no concern. That
  can then be addressed by "telephone-book"-like hashing techniques that
  are easy and lightning fast. The final presentation is then found to
  be competitive with established mappers like eXpress and Cufflinks.
