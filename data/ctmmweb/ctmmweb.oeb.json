        "description": "Scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled from animal tracking data.\n\nBackground:Speed and distance traveled provide quantifiable links between behavior and energetics, and are among the metrics most routinely estimated from animal tracking data. Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements (SLDs) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, SLD estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty. Methods:To overcome the limitations of SLD estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimation method.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CTSD'",
