Yet, paired normal tissues are not always available in clinical settings or for archival samples. Results: We present SomVarIUS, a computational method for detecting somatic variants using high throughput sequencing data from unpaired tissue samples. We evaluate the performance of the method using genomic data from synthetic and real tumor samples. SomVarIUS identifies somatic variants in exome-seq data of ∼150 × coverage with at least 67.7% precision and 64.6% recall rates, when compared with paired-tissue somatic variant calls in real tumor samples. We demonstrate the utility of SomVarIUS by identifying somatic mutations in formalin-fixed samples, and tracking clonal dynamics of oncogenic mutations in targeted deep sequencing data from pre- and post-treatment leukemia samples. Availability and implementation: SomVarIUS is written in Python 2.7 and available at http://www.sjdlab.org/resources/ Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
