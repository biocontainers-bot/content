summary: variant detection in next-generation sequencing data
description: >
  Variant detection in massively parallel sequencing. For one sample,
  calls SNPs, indels, and consensus genotypes. For tumor-normal pairs,
  further classifies each variant as Germline, Somatic, or LOH, and also
  detects somatic copy number changes.
