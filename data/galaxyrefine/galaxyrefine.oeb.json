Therefore, the importance of improving template-based model structures beyond the accuracy available from template information has been emphasized in the structure prediction community. The GalaxyRefine web server, freely available at http://galaxy.seoklab.org/refine, is based on a refinement method that has been successfully tested in CASP10. The method first rebuilds side chains and performs side-chain repacking and subsequent overall structure relaxation by molecular dynamics simulation. According to the CASP10 assessment, this method showed the best performance in improving the local structure quality. The method can improve both global and local structure quality on average, when used for refining the models generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction servers.",
