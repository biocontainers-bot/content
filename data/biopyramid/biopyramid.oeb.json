            "abstract": "Â© 2018 The Author(s). BioPyramid is a Python package, which serves as a scaffold for building an online application for the exploration of gene expression data. It is designed for bioinformaticians wishing to quickly share transformed data and interactive analyses with collaborators. Current R-based tools similarly address the need to quickly share 'omics'-data in an exploratory format, but these are generally small-scale, single-dataset solutions. Biopyramid is written in Python pyramid framework and scalable to address longer-term or more complex projects. It contains a number of components designed to reduce the time and effort in building such an application from scratch, including gene annotation, dataset models and visualization tools. Availability and implementation: Freely available at http://github.com/jarny/biopyramid. Implemented in python and javascript.",
