The program assumes knowledge of theoretical values for the imaginary term, f″, of the anomalous-scattering factor away from the absorption edge to scale the experimental fluorescence spectrum and thus derive values of f″ near the absorption edge, where tabular data are inappropriate. The Kramers - Kronig relation is used to calculate the real part, f′, of the anomalous-scattering factor. The program aids the decision-making process in macro-molecular crystallographic experiments where optimal wavelength selection is required. Magnitudes of f′ and f″ at selected wavelengths can later be used as starting values for heavy-atom refinement with crystallographic phasing programs.",
