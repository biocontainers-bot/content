The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism on isoflurane-induced general anesthesia. Materials and methods: The microarray data of GSE64617 dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 755 DEGs were identified using the limma package in the R programming language. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes, and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment were conducted for DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for DEGs and sensory perception related genes. A global miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed to reveal the interactions in miRNA and mRNA in isoflurane treated samples. Degree was used to evaluate the importance of a gene in the PPI network and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Results and conclusions: HMBOX1, CSNK2A1, PNN, SRRM1, PRPF40A, APCNTRK1, MAPK1, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-497-5p and hsa-miR-17-5p were selected as weighted genes. The expression changes were further vitrificated in the rat models by performing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. In conclusion, we find several weighted mRNAs and miRNAs involved in isoflurane induced general anesthesia through bioinformatics analysis.",
