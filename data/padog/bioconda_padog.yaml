description: This package implements a general purpose gene set analysis method called
  PADOG that downplays the importance of genes that apear often accross the sets of
  genes to be analyzed. The package provides also a benchmark for gene set analysis
  methods in terms of sensitivity and ranking using 24 public datasets from KEGGdzPathwaysGEO
  package.
