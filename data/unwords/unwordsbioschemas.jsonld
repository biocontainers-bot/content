  "sc:description": "An efficient software for computing shortest strings which do not occur in a given set of DNA sequences. It is more efficient than previous algorithms and easier to use. It uses bit vector encoding of strings and therefore we called it unwords-bits. It directly computes unwords without the need to specify a length estimate. Moreover, it avoids the space requirements of index structures such as suffix trees and suffix arrays.",
