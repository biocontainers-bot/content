summary: predictor of Gene Ontology terms from protein sequence - data files
description: >
  Often, only the sequence of a protein is known, but
  not its functions. Metastudent will try to predict
  missing functional annotations through homology searches (BLAST).
  .
  All predicted functions correspond to Gene Ontology (GO)
  terms from the Molecular Function Ontology (MFO) and the Biological Process
  Ontology (BPO) and are associated with a reliability score.
  .
  This package contains data files for metastudent.
