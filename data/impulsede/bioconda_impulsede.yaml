description: ImpulseDE is suited to capture single impulse-like patterns in high throughput
  time series datasets. By fitting a representative impulse model to each gene, it
  reports differentially expressed genes whether across time points in a single experiment
  or between two time courses from two experiments. To optimize the running time,
  the code makes use of clustering steps and multi-threading.
