Ligand binding is one of the major biochemical functions of proteins, and thus the identification of ligands and their binding sites is the starting point for the function identification. Previously we reported our first trial on structure-based function prediction, based on the similarity searches of molecular surfaces against the functional site database. Here we describe the extension of our first trial by expanding the search database to whole heteroatom binding sites appearing within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the new analysis protocol. In addition, we have determined the similarity threshold line, by using 10 structure pairs with solved free and complex structures. Finally, we extensively applied our method to newly determined hypothetical proteins, including some without annotations, and evaluated the performance of our methods.",

We have developed a new method to identify and predict protein biochemical functions using the similarity information of molecular surface geometries and electrostatic potentials on the surfaces. Our prediction system consists of a similarity search method based on a clique search algorithm and the molecular surface database eF-site (electrostatic surface of functional-site in proteins). Using this system, functional sites similar to those of phosphoenoylpyruvate carboxy kinase were detected in several mononucleotide-binding proteins, which have different folds. We also applied our method to a hypothetical protein, MJ0226 from Methanococcus jannaschii, and detected the mononucleotide binding site from the similarity to other proteins having different folds.",

            "abstract": "A bioinformatics method was developed to identify the protein surface around the functional site and to estimate the biochemical function, using a newly constructed molecular surface database named the eF-site (electrostatic surface of Functional site. Molecular surfaces of protein molecules were computed based on the atom coordinates, and the eF-site database was prepared by adding the physical properties on the constructed molecular surfaces. The electrostatic potential on each molecular surface was individually calculated solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically for the precise continuum model, and the hydrophobicity information of each residue was also included. The eF-site database is accessed by the internet (http://pi.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp/eF-site/). We have prepared four different databases, eF-site/antibody, eF-site/prosite, eF-site/P-site, and eF-site/ActiveSite, corresponding to the antigen binding sites of antibodies with the same orientations, the molecular surfaces for the individual motifs in PROSITE database, the phosphate binding sites, and the active site surfaces for the representatives of the individual protein family, respectively. An algorithm using the clique detection method as an applied graph theory was developed to search of the eF-site database, so as to recognize and discriminate the characteristic molecular surfaces of the proteins. The method identifies the active site having the similar function to those of the known proteins.",
