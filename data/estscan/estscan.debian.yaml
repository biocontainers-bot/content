summary: ORF-independent detector of coding DNA sequences
description: >
  ESTScan is a program that can detect coding regions in DNA sequences,
  even if they are of low quality. ESTScan will also detect and correct
  sequencing errors that lead to frameshifts.  ESTScan is not a gene
  prediction program , nor is it an open reading frame detector. In fact,
  its strength lies in the fact that it does not require an open reading
  frame to detect a coding region. As a result, the program may miss a
  few translated amino acids at either the N or the C terminus, but will
  detect coding regions with high selectivity and sensitivity.
  .
  ESTScan takes advantages of the bias in hexanucleotide usage found in
  coding regions relative to non-coding regions. This bias is formalized
  as an inhomogeneous 3-periodic fifth-order Hidden Markov Model
  (HMM). Additionally, the HMM of ESTScan has been extended to allows
  insertions and deletions when these improve the coding region statistics.
