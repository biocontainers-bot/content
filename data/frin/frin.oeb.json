        "description": "An Efficient Method for Representing Genome Evolutionary History.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis is important in understanding the process of biological evolution, and phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolutionary history. Each taxon in a phylogenetic tree has not more than one parent, so phylogenetic trees cannot express the complex evolutionary information implicit in phylogeny. Phylogenetic networks can be used to express genome evolutionary histories. Therefore, it is great significance to research the construction of phylogenetic networks. Cass algorithm is an efficient method for constructing phylogenetic networks because it can construct a much simpler network. However, Cass relies heavily on the order of input data, i.e. different networks can be constructed for the same dataset with different input orders. Based on the frequency and incompatibility degree of taxa, we propose an efficiently improved algorithm of Cass, called as Frin",
