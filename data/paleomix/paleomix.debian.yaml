summary: pipelines and tools for the processing of ancient and modern HTS data
description: >
  The PALEOMIX pipelines are a set of pipelines and tools designed to aid
  the rapid processing of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data: The BAM
  pipeline processes de-multiplexed reads from one or more samples,
  through sequence processing and alignment, to generate BAM alignment
  files useful in downstream analyses; the Phylogenetic pipeline carries
  out genotyping and phylogenetic inference on BAM alignment files, either
  produced using the BAM pipeline or generated elsewhere; and the Zonkey
  pipeline carries out a suite of analyses on low coverage equine
  alignments, in order to detect the presence of F1-hybrids in
  archaeological assemblages. In addition, PALEOMIX aids in metagenomic
  analysis of the extracts.
  .
  The pipelines have been designed with ancient DNA (aDNA) in mind, and
  includes several features especially useful for the analyses of ancient
  samples, but can all be for the processing of modern samples, in order
  to ensure consistent data processing.
