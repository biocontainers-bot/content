            "abstract": "Predicting secondary structures from a protein sequence is an important step for characterizing the structural properties of a protein. Existing methods for protein secondary structure prediction can be broadly classified into template based or sequence profile based methods. We propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between the two fundamentally different approaches. Our framework integrates the information from the fuzzy le-nearest neighbor algorithm and position-specific scoring matrices using a neural network. It combines the strengths of the two methods and has a better potential to use the information in both the sequence and structure databases than existing methods. We implemented the framework into a software system MUPRED. MUPRED has achieved three-state prediction accuracy (Q3) ranging from 79.2 to 80.14%, depending on which benchmark dataset is used. A higher Q3 can be achieved if a query protein has a significant sequence identity (> 25%) to a template in PDB. MUPRED also estimates the prediction accuracy at the individual residue level more quantitatively than existing methods.
