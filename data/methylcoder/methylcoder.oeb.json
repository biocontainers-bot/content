It provides the option to use either of two existing short-read aligners, each with different strengths. It accounts for soft-masked alignments and overlapping paired-end reads. MethylCoder outputs data in text and binary formats in addition to the nal alignment in SAM format, so that common high-throughput sequencing tools can be used on the resulting output. It is more exible than existing software and competitive in terms of speed and memory use. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
