  "sc:description": "HaploBlock is a software program which provides an integrated approach to haplotype block identification, haplotyping SNPs (or haplotype phasing, resolution or reconstruction) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping (or genetic association studies). HaploBlock is suitable for high density haplotype or genotype SNP marker data and is based on a statistical model which takes account of recombination hotspots, bottlenecks, genetic drift and mutations and has a Markov Chain at its core.",
