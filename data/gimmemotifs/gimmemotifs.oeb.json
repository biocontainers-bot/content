Here we report on GimmeMotifs, a pipeline that incorporates an ensemble of computational tools to predict motifs de novo from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Similar redundant motifs are compared using the weighted information content (WIC) similarity score and clustered using an iterative procedure. A comprehensive output report is generated with several different evaluation metrics to compare and evaluate the results. Benchmarks show that the method performs well on human and mouse ChIP-seq datasets. GimmeMotifs consists of a suite of command-line scripts that can be easily implemented in a ChIP-seq analysis pipeline. Â© The Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.",
