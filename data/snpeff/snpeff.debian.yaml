summary: genetic variant annotation and effect prediction toolbox
description: >
  SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It annotates
  and predicts the effects of variants on genes (such as amino acid
  changes). 
  .
  The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions and
  MNPs). The input file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing
  experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF).
  .
  SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates the variants and
  calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino acid
  changes). A list of effects and annotations that SnpEff can calculate
  can be found here.
