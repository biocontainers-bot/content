summary: Advanced Data Analysis of Immune Receptor Repertoires
description: >
  Cells of the immune system are the grand exception to the rule
  that all cells of an individuum have (mostly exact) copies of the
  same DNA. B cells (which produce antibodies) and T cells (which
  communicate with cells) however have a section of their DNA with
  genes of the groups V, D and J that are reorganised within the
  genomic DNA to provide the flexibility to deal with yet unknown
  pathogens.
  .
  This package provides a platform for the advanced analysis of T
  cell receptor repertoire data and its visualisations.
