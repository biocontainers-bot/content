How phages select receptors is still unknown. Results Here, we manually curated a high-quality database named phageReceptor, including 355 pairs of phage-host receptor interactions, 280 unique viral species or sub-species and 64 bacterial species. Sugars and proteins were most widely used by phages as receptors. The receptor usage of phages in Gram-positive bacteria was different from that in Gram-negative bacteria. Most protein receptors were located on the outer membrane. The protein receptors were highly diverse in their structures, and had little homology with mammalian virus receptors",
