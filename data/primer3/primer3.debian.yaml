summary: tool to design flanking oligo nucleotides for DNA amplification
description: >
  Primer3 picks primers for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs), considering as
  criteria oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content and
  primer-dimer possibilities, PCR product size, positional constraints within
  the source sequence, and miscellaneous other constraints. All of these
  criteria are user-specifiable as constraints, and some are specifiable as
  terms in an objective function that characterizes an optimal primer pair.
