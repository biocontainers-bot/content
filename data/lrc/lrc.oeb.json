Recently, several methods have been presented to predict epitopes. The physicochemical or structural properties are used by these methods. In this paper, we propose a more appropriate epitope prediction method, LRC, that is based on a combination of physicochemical and structural properties. First, we construct a graph from the surface of antigen, then by using the logistic regression, we model the physicochemical and structural properties and weight each vertex of the graph. Finally, we utilize a clustering method, MCL, to cluster the graph. The effectiveness of the proposed method is benchmarked using several antibody-antigen PDB complexes. The results of LRC algorithm are compared with other methods (DiscoTope, SEPPA and Ellipro) in terms of sensitivity, specificity and other well-known measures. Results indicate that applying the LRC algorithm improves the precision of prediction epitopes in comparison with the mentioned methods.
