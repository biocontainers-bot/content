summary: Molecular dynamics simulator, with building and analysis tools
description: >
  GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate
  the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
  particles.
  .
  It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids
  that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is
  extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually
  dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-
  biological systems, e.g. polymers.
