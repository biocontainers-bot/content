description: This package is designed for the import, quality control, analysis, and
  visualization of methylation data generated using Sequenom's MassArray platform.  The
  tools herein contain a highly detailed amplicon prediction for optimal assay design.
  Also included are quality control measures of data, such as primer dimer and bisulfite
  conversion efficiency estimation. Methylation data are calculated using the same
  algorithms contained in the EpiTyper software package.  Additionally, automatic
  SNP-detection can be used to flag potentially confounded data from specific CG sites.  Visualization
  includes barplots of methylation data as well as UCSC Genome Browser-compatible
  BED tracks.  Multiple assays can be positionally combined for integrated analysis.
