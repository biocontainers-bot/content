It performs automated mapping of the functional annotations onto the protein structure and allows functional sites to be readily identified upon visualization. The current version of ProSAT can be applied to large datasets of protein structures for fast visual identification of active and other functional sites derived from the SwissProt and Prosite databases. © Oxford University Press 2001.",

As the successor of ProSAT (Protein Structure Annotation Tool), it includes its features for visualizing SwissProt and PROSITE functional annotations. Currently, the ProSAT2 server can perform automated mapping of information on variants and mutations from the UniProt KnowledgeBase and the BRENDA enzyme information system onto protein structures. It also accepts and maps user-prepared annotations. By means of an annotation selector, the user can interactively select and group residue-based information according to criteria such as whether a mutation affects enzyme activity. The visualization of the protein structures is based on the WebMol Java molecular viewer and permits simultaneous highlighting of annotated residues and viewing of the corresponding descriptive texts.
