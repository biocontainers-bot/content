This approach enables characterization of glycopeptides and structures of O-glycans on a proteome-wide scale with quantification of stoichiometries (though it does not allow for direct unambiguous glycosite identification). The method relies on a spectral library of O-glycopeptides; the Glyco-DIA library contains sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the 5 most common core1 O-glycan structures. Applying the Glyco-DIA library to human serum without enrichment for glycopeptides enabled us to identify and quantify 269 distinct glycopeptide sequences bearing up to 5 different core1 O-glycans from 159 glycoproteins in a SingleShot analysis.",
