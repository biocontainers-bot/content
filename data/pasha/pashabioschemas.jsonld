  "sc:description": "It is a parallel short read assembler for large genomes using de Bruijn graphs. Taking advantage of both shared-memory multi-core CPUs and distributed-memory compute clusters, it has demonstrated its potential to perform high-quality de-novo assembly of large genomes in reasonable time with modest computing resources.",
