description: Expedite large RNA-Seq analyses using a combination of previously developed
  tools. YARN is meant to make it easier for the user in performing basic mis-annotation
  quality control, filtering, and condition-aware normalization. YARN leverages many
  Bioconductor tools and statistical techniques to account for the large heterogeneity
  and sparsity found in very large RNA-seq experiments.
