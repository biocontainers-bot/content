It is focused on light-responsive Ï€-conjugated organic molecules with applications in green chemistry, organic solar cells, and organic redox flow batteries. It includes results of our active and past virtual screening studies; to date, more than 11,000 density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed on at least 1,282 molecules to obtain ground- and excited-state structures and photophysical properties",
