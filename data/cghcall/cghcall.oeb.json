The algorithm is validated for simulated and verified real array CGH data. By incorporating more than three classes, CGHcall improves detection of single copy gains and amplifications. Moreover, it allows effective inclusion of chromosome arm information. Â© The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
