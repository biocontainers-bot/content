summary: GNU R bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling
description: >
  Resolves complex metagenomic mixtures by analysing deep sequencing
  data, using a mixture model based approach. The use of parallel Monte
  Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables
  the identification of the set of species more likely to contribute to
  the mixture.
