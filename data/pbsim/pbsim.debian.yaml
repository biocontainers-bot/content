summary: simulator for PacBio sequencing reads
description: >
  PacBio DNA sequencers produce two types of characteristic reads: CCS
  (short and low error rate) and CLR (long and high error rate), both of
  which could be useful for de novo assembly of genomes. PBSIM simulates
  those PacBio reads from a reference sequence by using either a model-based
  or sampling-based simulation. Simulated reads are useful, for example, when
  developing or evaluating sequence assemblers targeted at PacBio data.
