  "sc:description": "DNA mapping program that draws plasmid or linear DNA maps showing features such as genes, multiple cloning sites and restriction sites. The maps are highly customizable. Fragments can be copied or cut, and inserted into different maps or turned into maps on their own (virtual cloning). FastA, text, and GenBank files can be imported directly, making maps of long and complex sequences (e.g. genomic sequences) quick and easy to prepare.",
