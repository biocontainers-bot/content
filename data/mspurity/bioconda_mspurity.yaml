description: 'msPurity R package was developed to: 1) Assess the spectral quality
  of fragmentation spectra by evaluating the "precursor ion purity". 2) Process fragmentation
  spectra. 3) Perform spectral matching. What is precursor ion purity? -What we call
  "Precursor ion purity" is a measure of the contribution of a selected precursor
  peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation. The simple calculation involves
  dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity of
  the isolation window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done before
  and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the purity is interpolated at the recorded
  time of the MS/MS acquisition. Additionally, isotopic peaks can be removed, low
  abundance peaks are removed that are thought to have limited contribution to the
  resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can
  be used to normalise the intensities used for the calculation.'
