  "sc:description": "An algorithm for atomic-level, high-resolution protein structure refinement, which can start from either C-alpha trace, main-chain model or full-atomic model. Both side-chain and backbone atoms are completely flexible during structure refinement simulations, where conformational search is guided by a composite of physics- and knowledge-based force field.",
