  "sc:description": "IsobariQ is a program designed for use in quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics. It is a novel tool for accurate quantification of IPTL, iTRAQ and TMT data, and currently, it is the only freely available tool to analyse IPTL data.  It allows the user to examine proteomic data in detail and interactively through a graphical user interface. In addition, it provides the user with advanced statistical analysis, including recently published variance stabilising normalisation (VSN).",
