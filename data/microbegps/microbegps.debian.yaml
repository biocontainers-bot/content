summary: explorative taxonomic profiling tool for metagenomic data
description: >
  MicrobeGPS is a bioinformatics tool for the analysis of metagenomic
  sequencing data. The goal is to profile the composition of metagenomic
  communities as accurately as possible and present the results to the
  user in a convenient manner. One main focus is reliability: the tool
  calculates quality metrics for the estimated candidates and allows the
  user to identify false candidates easily.
