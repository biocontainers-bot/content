However, single-cell data present unique challenges that require the development of specialized methods and software infrastructure to successfully derive biological insights. The Bioconductor project has rapidly grown to meet these demands, hosting community-developed open-source software distributed as R packages. Featuring state-of-the-art computational methods, standardized data infrastructure and interactive data visualization tools, we present an overview and online book (https://osca.bioconductor.org) of single-cell methods for prospective users.",
