            "abstract": "So far, most methods for identifying sequences under selection based on comparative sequence data have either assumed selectional pressures are the same across all branches of a phylogeny, or have focused on changes in specific lineages of interest. Here, we introduce a more general method that detects sequences that have either come under selection, or begun to drift, on any lineage. The method is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM), and does not require element boundaries to be determined a priori, making it particularly useful for identifying noncoding sequences. Insertions and deletions (indels) are incorporated into the phylo-HMM by a simple strategy that uses a separately reconstructed \"indel history.\" To evaluate the statistical significance of predictions, we introduce a novel method for computing P-values based on prior and posterior distributions of the number of substitutions that have occurred in the evolution of predicted elements. We derive efficient dynamic-programming algorithms for obtaining these distributions, given a model of neutral evolution. Our methods have been implemented as computer programs called DLESS (Detection of LinEage-Specific Selection) and phyloP (phylogenetic P-values). We discuss results obtained with these programs on both real and simulated data sets. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.",
