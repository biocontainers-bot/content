        "description": "improved chaperone binding prediction using position-independent scoring matrices | ChaperISM is an algorithm to identify Hsp70 binding sequences in proteins. It uses a position-independent scoring matrix which was trained on either qualitative or quantitative chemiluminescence data previously published, obtained from interaction between DnaK and different ligands. Both versions of ChaperISM, qualitative or quantitative, resulted in an improved performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art chaperone binding predictors",
