        "description": "A theoretical explanation for Lewis’s law and Aboav-Weaire’s law.\n\nBackground: Lewis’s law and Aboav-Weaire’s law are two fundamental laws used to describe the topology of two-dimensional (2D) structures; however, their theoretical bases remain unclear. Methods: We used R package Conicfit software to fit ellipses based on the geometric parameters of polygonal cells with ten different kinds of natural and artificial 2D structures. Results: Our results indicated that the cells could be classified as ellipse’s inscribed polygon (EIP) and that they tended to form ellipse’s maximal inscribed polygon (EMIP). This phenomenon was named as ellipse packing. On the basis of the number of cell edges, cell area, and semi-axes of fitted ellipses, we derived and verified new relations of Lewis’s law and Aboav-Weaire’s law.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ellipse', 'packing', 'ellipse packing', 'Conicfit'",
