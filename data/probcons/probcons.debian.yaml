summary: PROBabilistic CONSistency-based multiple sequence alignment
description: >
  Tool for generating multiple alignments of protein sequences. Using a
  combination of probabilistic modeling and consistency-based alignment
  techniques, PROBCONS has achieved the highest accuracies of all alignment
  methods to date. On the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database, alignments
  produced by PROBCONS show statistically significant improvement over current
  programs, containing an average of 7% more correctly aligned columns than
  those of T-Coffee, 11% more correctly aligned columns than those of CLUSTAL W,
  and 14% more correctly aligned columns than those of DIALIGN.
