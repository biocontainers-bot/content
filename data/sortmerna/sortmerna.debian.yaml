summary: tool for filtering, mapping and OTU-picking NGS reads
description: >
  SortMeRNA is a biological sequence analysis tool for filtering, mapping and
  OTU-picking NGS reads. The core algorithm is based on approximate seeds and
  allows for fast and sensitive analyses of nucleotide sequences. The main
  application of SortMeRNA is filtering rRNA from metatranscriptomic data.
  Additional applications include OTU-picking and taxonomy assignation available
  through QIIME v1.9+ (http://qiime.org - v1.9.0-rc1).
  SortMeRNA takes as input a file of reads (fasta or fastq format) and one or
  multiple rRNA database file(s), and sorts apart rRNA and rejected reads into
  two files specified by the user. Optionally, it can provide high quality local
  alignments of rRNA reads against the rRNA database. SortMeRNA works with
  Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent and PacBio data, and can produce SAM and
  BLAST-like alignments.
