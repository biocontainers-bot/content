Submitted sequences are aligned to each of about 3000 templates with a conventional dynamic programming algorithm, but using a score function with sophisticated structure and sequence terms. The structure terms are a log-odds probability of sequence to structure fragment compatibility, obtained from a Bayesian classification procedure. A simplex optimization was used to optimize the sequence-based terms for the goal of alignment and model quality and to balance the sequence and structural contributions against each other. Both sequence and structural terms operate with sequence profiles. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
