With increased generation of high-resolution sequence-based ?Omics? data, detecting statistically significant effects at different genomic locations and scales has become key to addressing several scientific questions. IWTomics is an R/Bioconductor package (integrated in Galaxy) that, exploiting sophisticated Functional Data Analysis techniques (i.e. statistical techniques that deal with the analysis of curves), allows users to pre-process, visualize and test these data at multiple locations and scales. The package provides a friendly, flexible and complete workflow that can be employed in many genomic and epigenomic applications.",
