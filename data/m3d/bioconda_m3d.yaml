description: This package identifies statistically significantly differentially methylated
  regions of CpGs. It uses kernel methods (the Maximum Mean Discrepancy) to measure
  differences in methylation profiles, and relates these to inter-replicate changes,
  whilst accounting for variation in coverage profiles.
