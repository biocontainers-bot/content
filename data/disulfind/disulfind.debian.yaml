summary: cysteines disulfide bonding state and connectivity predictor
description: >
  'disulfinder' is for predicting the disulfide bonding state of cysteines
  and their disulfide connectivity starting from sequence alone. Disulfide
  bridges play a major role in the stabilization of the folding process for
  several proteins. Prediction of disulfide bridges from sequence alone is
  therefore useful for the study of structural and functional properties
  of specific proteins. In addition, knowledge about the disulfide bonding
  state of cysteines may help the experimental structure determination
  process and may be useful in other genomic annotation tasks.
  .
  'disulfinder' predicts disulfide patterns in two computational stages:
  (1) the disulfide bonding state of each cysteine is predicted by a
  BRNN-SVM binary classifier; (2) cysteines that are known to participate
  in the formation of bridges are paired by a Recursive Neural Network
  to obtain a connectivity pattern.
