summary: predicts if a substitution in a protein has a phenotypic effect
description: >
  SIFT is a sequence homology-based tool that sorts intolerant from tolerant
  amino acid substitutions and predicts whether an amino acid substitution
  in a protein will have a phenotypic effect. SIFT is based on the premise
  that protein evolution is correlated with protein function. Positions
  important for function should be conserved in an alignment of the protein
  family, whereas unimportant positions should appear diverse in an alignment.
