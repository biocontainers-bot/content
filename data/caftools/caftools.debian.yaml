summary: maintenance of DNA sequence assemblies
description: >
  This package contains code from different authors that allow sequence
  assemblies to be converted into formats such as CAF (Common Assembly
  Format) or GAP4.
  .
  CAF is a text format for describing sequence assemblies. It
  is acedb-compliant and is an extension of the ace-file format used
  earlier, but with support for base quality measures and a more extensive
  description of the Sequence data. CAF was designed during the Sanger
  sequencing era. Its modern-day successor is the SAM format, or its
  binary equivalents BAM and CRAM.
version: 2.0.2
