Dr. Wilcox’s unique and engaging talk gave insight into an intervention that is being both disseminated and implemented within faith-based communities in South Carolina. Dr. Wilcox discusses her use of RE-AIM and how the framework was able to both help in the planning, evaluation, and aid in the development of future steps in her work.\n\nFor this month, we are bringing you our most recent webinar that occurred in December 2019. The last webinar of the decade!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/RE-AIM.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RE-AIM Real World'",
