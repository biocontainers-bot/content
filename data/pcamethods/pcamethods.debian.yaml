summary: BioConductor collection of PCA methods
description: >
  Provides Bayesian PCA, Probabilistic PCA, Nipals PCA,
  Inverse Non-Linear PCA and the conventional SVD PCA. A cluster
  based method for missing value estimation is included for
  comparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA may be used to perform PCA
  on incomplete data as well as for accurate missing value
  estimation. A set of methods for printing and plotting the
  results is also provided. All PCA methods make use of the same
  data structure (pcaRes) to provide a common interface to the
  PCA results. Initiated at the Max-Planck Institute for
  Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany.
