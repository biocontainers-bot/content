summary: assessment of SNPs for their evolutionary advantage
description: >
  Biological sequences are available in ever increasing abundance across
  ever larger populations for ever increasing fractions of the genome. This
  tool sorts the SNPs for their active or passive contribution to a genetic
  drift, i.e. to see particular sequences at a higher fraction over time.
