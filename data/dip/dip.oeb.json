Tools have been developed that allow users to analyze, visualize and integrate their own experimental data with the information about protein-protein interactions available in the DIP database.",

This CORE set can be used as a reference when evaluating the reliability of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets, for development of prediction methods, as well as in the studies of the properties of protein interaction networks.",
