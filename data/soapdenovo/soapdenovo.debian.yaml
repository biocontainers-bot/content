summary: short-read assembly method to build de novo draft assembly
description: >
  SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft
  assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to
  assemble Illumina GA short reads.
  .
  It creates new opportunities for building reference
  sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost
  effective way.
