summary: pipeline for building loci from short-read DNA sequences
description: >
  Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences,
  such as those generated on the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work
  with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for the purpose of
  building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.
  .
  Note that this package installs Stacks such that all commands must be run as:
  $ stacks <cmdname> <args>
version: 2.41
