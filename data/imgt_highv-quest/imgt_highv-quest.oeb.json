Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (http://www.imgt.org) is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. By its creation in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Université de Montpellier and CNRS), IMGT marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. IMGT is specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) and proteins of the IgSF and MhSF superfamilies. IMGT is built on the IMGTONTOLOGY axioms and concepts, which bridged the gap between genes, sequences and 3D structures. The concepts include the IMGTR standardized keywords (identification), IMGTR standardized labels (description), IMGTR standardized nomenclature (classification), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles (numerotation). IMGTR comprises 7 databases, 17 online tools and 15 000 pages of web resources, and provides a high-quality and integrated system for analysis of the genomic and expressed IG and TR repertoire of the adaptive immune responses, including NGS high-throughput data. Tools and databases are used in basic, veterinary and medical research, in clinical applications (mutation analysis in leukemia and lymphoma) and in antibody engineering and humanization. The IMGT/mAb-DB interface was developed for therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins for immunological applications (FPIA). IMGTR is freely available at http://www.imgt.org.",

            "abstract": "IMGT/V-QUEST is the highly customized and integrated online IMGT ® tool for the standardized analysis of the immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody and T cell receptor (TR) rearranged nucleotide sequences. The analysis of these antigen receptors represents a crucial challenge for the study of the adaptive immune response in normal and disease-related situations. The expressed IG and TR repertoires represent a potential of 1012 IG and 1012 TR per individual. This huge diversity results from mechanisms that occur at the DNA level during the IG and TR molecular synthesis. These mechanisms include the combinatorial rearrangements of the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes, the N-diversity (deletion and addition at random of nucleotides during the V-(D)-J rearrangement) and, for IG, somatic hypermutations. IMGT/V-QUEST identifies the V, D, J genes and alleles by alignment with the germline IG and TR gene and allele sequences of the IMGT reference directory. The tool describes the V-REGION mutations and identifies the hot spot positions in the closest germline V gene. IMGT/V-QUEST integrates IMGT/JunctionAnalysis for a detailed analysis of the V-J and V-D-J junctions and IMGT/Automat for a complete annotation of the sequences and also provides IMGT Collier de Perles. IMGT/HighV-QUEST, the high-throughput version of IMGT/V-QUEST, implemented to answer the needs of deep sequencing data analysis from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), allows the analysis of thousands of IG and TR sequences in a single run. IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/HighV-QUEST are available at the IMGT® Home page, http://www.imgt.org. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",
