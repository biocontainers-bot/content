            "abstract": "p53MutaGene is the first online tool for statistical validation of hypotheses regarding the effect of p53 mutational status on gene regulation in cancer. This tool is based on several large-scale clinical gene expression data sets and currently covers breast, colon and lung cancers. The tool detects differential co-expression patterns in expression data between p53 mutated versus p53 normal samples for the user-specified genes. Statistically significant differential co-expression for a gene pair is indicative that regulation of two genes is sensitive to the presence of p53 mutations. p53MutaGene can be used in 'single mode' where the user can test a specific pair of genes or in 'discovery mode' designed for analysis of several genes. Using several examples, we demonstrate that p53MutaGene is a useful tool for fast statistical validation in clinical data of p53-dependent gene regulation patterns. The tool is freely available at http://www.bioprofiling.de/tp53.",
