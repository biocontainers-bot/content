There are still open challenges concerning helix and sheet assignments which are currently not addressed by a single multi-purpose software. RESULTS:We introduce SCOT (Secondary structure Classification On Turns) as a novel secondary structure element assignment software which supports the assignment of turns, right-handed α-, 310-, and π-helices, left-handed α- and 310-helices, 2.27- and polyproline II helices, β-sheets, and kinks. We demonstrate that the introduction of helix Purity values enables a clear differentiation between helix classes. SCOT's unique strengths are highlighted by comparing it to six state-of-the-art methods (DSSP, STRIDE, ASSP, SEGNO, DISICL, and SHAFT).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
