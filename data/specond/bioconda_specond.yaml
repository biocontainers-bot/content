description: This package performs a gene expression data analysis to detect condition-specific
  genes. Such genes are significantly up- or down-regulated in a small number of conditions.
  It does so by fitting a mixture of normal distributions to the expression values.
  Conditions can be environmental conditions, different tissues, organs or any other
  sources that you wish to compare in terms of gene expression.
