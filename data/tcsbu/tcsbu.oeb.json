All rights reserved.Motivation: TCS is a widely used haplotype network reconstruction software, but lacks the capability of overlapping genetic with geographic structure, which is often a first step in phylogeographic analysis. Results: tcsBU is a web-based program that extends the capabilities of TCS, by implementing haplotype classification into an arbitrary user-defined scheme, which is displayed as pie-chart like graphs embedded into the network. Taking advantage of modern graphic libraries, tcsBU also improves the speed at which the final network layout is reached. Networks can be saved as a Scalable Vector Graphics format. Availability and implementation: tcsBU is available on-line at http://cibio.up.pt/software/tcsBU/.
