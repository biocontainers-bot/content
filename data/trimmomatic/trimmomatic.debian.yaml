summary: flexible read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data
description: >
  Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina
  paired-end and single ended data.The selection of trimming steps and
  their associated parameters are supplied on the command line.
  .
  The current trimming steps are:
   * ILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other illumina-specific sequences from
     the read.
   * SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once thes
     average quality within the window falls below a threshold.
   * LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality
   * TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality
   * CROP: Cut the read to a specified length
   * HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read
   * MINLENGTH: Drop the read if it is below a specified length
   * TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33
   * TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64
  It works with FASTQ (using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores,
  depending on the Illumina pipeline used), either uncompressed or
  gzipp'ed FASTQ. Use of gzip format is determined based on the .gz
  extension.
