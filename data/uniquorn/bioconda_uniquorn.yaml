description: This packages enables users to identify cancer cell lines. Cancer cell
  line misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a significant challenge
  for cancer researchers. The identification is vital and in the frame of this package
  based on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/ variations. The
  input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have to contain a single cancer cell line
  sample (i.e. a single member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file). The implemented
  method is optimized for the Next-generation whole exome and whole genome DNA-sequencing
  technology. RNA-seq data is very likely to work as well but hasn't been rigiously
  tested yet. Panel-seq will require manual adjustment of thresholds
