  "sc:description": "Identifies potential endogenous or exogenous allosteric modulators as well as their characterization in human allosterome. Automatically amalgamates allosteric site identification, allosteric screening and allosteric scoring evaluation of modulatorâ€“protein complexes to identify allosteric modulators, followed by allosterome mapping analyses of predicted allosteric sites and modulators in human proteome. Enables identification of allosteric metabolites for metabolic enzymes and screening of potential allosteric compounds for disease-related targets.",
