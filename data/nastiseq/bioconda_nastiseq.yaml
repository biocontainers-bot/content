summary: Pairs of RNA molecules transcribed from partially or entirely complementary
  loci are called cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs), and they play key
  roles in the regulation of gene expression in many organisms. A promising experimental
  tool for profiling sense and antisense transcription is strand-specific RNA sequencing
  (ssRNA-seq). To identify cis-NATs using ssRNA-seq, we developed a new computational
  method based on model comparison that incorporates the inherent variable efficiency
  of generating perfectly strand-specific libraries. Applying the method to new ssRNA-seq
  data from whole root and cell-type specific Arabidopsis libraries confirmed most
  of the known cis-NAT pairs and identified hundreds of additional cis-NAT pairs.
