            "abstract": "© 2019High-throughput single-cell sequencing methods allow for the identification of allelic inclusion T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, though experimental errors preclude direct measurement of dual receptor T cell rates. We develop and experimentally validate a statistical inference model in order to accurately estimate the rate of ααβ and αββ allelic inclusion T cells. Our results show that approximately 15% of T cells express more than one unique TCR and suggest that these allelic inclusion cells represent a functionally important component of the human TCR repertoire. © 2019A small population of αβ T cells is characterized by the expression of more than one unique T cell receptor (TCR); this outcome is the result of “allelic inclusion,” that is, inclusion of both α- or β-chain alleles during V(D)J recombination. Limitations in single-cell sequencing technology, however, have precluded comprehensive enumeration of these dual receptor T cells. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a fully Bayesian inference model capable of reliably estimating the true rate of α and β TCR allelic inclusion across two different emulsion-barcoding single-cell sequencing platforms. We provide a database composed of over 51,000 previously unpublished allelic inclusion TCR sequence sets drawn from eight healthy individuals and show that allelic inclusion contributes a distinct and functionally important set of sequences to the human TCR repertoire. This database and a Python implementation of our statistical inference model are freely available at our Github repository (https://github.com/JasonACarter/Allelic_inclusion).",
