            "abstract": "Motivation: Local motifs are patterns of DNA or protein sequences that occur within a sequence interval relative to a biologically defined anchor or landmark. Current protein motif discovery methods do not adequately consider such constraints to identify biologically significant motifs that are only weakly over-represented but spatially confined. Using negatives, i.e. sequences known to not contain a local motif, can further increase the specificity of their discovery.Results: This article introduces the method DLocalMotif that makes use of positional information and negative data for local motif discovery in protein sequences. DLocalMotif combines three scoring functions, measuring degrees of motif over-representation, entropy and spatial confinement, specifically designed to discriminatively exploit the availability of negative data. The method is shown to outperform current methods that use only a subset of these motif characteristics. We apply the method to several biological datasets. The analysis of peroxisomal targeting signals uncovers several novel motifs that occur immediately upstream of the dominant peroxisomal targeting signal-1 signal. The analysis of proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signals uncovers multiple novel motifs that overlap with C2H2 zinc finger domains. We also evaluate the method on classical nuclear localization signals and endoplasmic reticulum retention signals and find that DLocalMotif successfully recovers biologically relevant sequence properties.

It uses three discriminitive scoring features, motif spatial confinement (MSC), motif over-representation (MOR) and motif relative entropy (MRE). These features establish if a motif is positioned in a constrained sequence interval in positive data set and absent in negative data set.",
