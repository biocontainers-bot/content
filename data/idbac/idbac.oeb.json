            "abstract": "Â© 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. For decades, researchers have lacked the ability to rapidly correlate microbial identity with bacterial metabolism. Since specialized metabolites are critical to bacterial function and survival in the environment, we designed a data acquisition and bioinformatics technique (IDBac) that utilizes in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra recorded from single bacterial colonies picked from agar plates. We demonstrated the power of our approach by discriminating between two Bacillus subtilis strains in <30 min solely on the basis of their differential ability to produce cyclic peptide antibiotics surfactin and plipastatin, caused by a single frameshift mutation. Next, we used IDBac to detect subtle intraspecies differences in the production of metal scavenging acyl-desferrioxamines in a group of eight freshwater Micromonospora isolates that share >99% sequence similarity in the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, we used IDBac to simultaneously extract protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles from unidentified Lake Michigan sponge-associated bacteria isolated from an agar plate. In just 3 h, we created hierarchical protein MS groupings of 11 environmental isolates (10 MS replicates each, for a total of 110 spectra) that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings. We further distinguished isolates within these groupings, which share nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, based on interspecies and intraspecies differences in specialized metabolite production. IDBac is an attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production to allow for facile discrimination of closely related bacterial colonies.",

Here, we present procedures for the preparation of bacterial colonies for MALDI-TOF MS analysis, MS instrument operation, and data processing and visualization in IDBac. In particular, we instruct users how to cluster bacteria into dendrograms based on protein MS fingerprints and interactively create Metabolite Association Networks (MANs) from specialized metabolite data.",
