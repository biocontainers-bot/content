  "sc:description": "The Platform for Interactive Learning by Genomics Results Mining (PILGRIM) is an interactive data driven discovery platform for biology. Expression levels of known relevant genes (specified by the user) are used to discover additional genes with similar expression patterns in large compendia of microarray data.  By carefully defining the lists of relevant genes, the user controls the specificity of discoveries.",
