summary: Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable domain sequence analysis
description: >
  IgBLAST allows users to view the matches to the germline V, D, and J
  genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of IG V
  domain framework regions, and complementarity determining regions.
  IgBLAST has the capability to analyse nucleotide and protein
  sequences, and can process sequences in batches.  Furthermore,
  IgBLAST allows searches against the germline gene databases and other
  sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing
  possibly the best matching germline V gene.
