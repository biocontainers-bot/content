While many sequence features associated with such islands have been adopted separately in applications for analysis of genomic islands, including pathogenicity islands, there is no single application that integrates multiple features for island detection. IslandPath is a network service which incorporates multiple DNA signals and genome annotation features into a graphical display of a bacterial or archaeal genome, to aid the detection of genomic islands.",
