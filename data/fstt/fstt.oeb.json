As herein reviewed, measurement methods are highly varied in FSTT studies and associated measurement errors have generally not been paid much attention.

Where informative error measurement protocols are employed (5% of studies), the mean error magnitudes range from 3% to 45% rTEM and are typically in the order of 10–20%. These values demonstrate that FSTT measurement errors are similar in size to (and likely larger than) the magnitudes of many biological effects being chased. As a result, the attribution of small millimeter or submillimeter differences in FSTT to biological variables must be undertaken with caution, especially where they have not been repeated across different studies/samples. To improve the integrity of FSTT studies and the reporting of FSTT measurement errors, we propose the following standard: (1) calculate the technical error of measurement (TEM or rTEM) in any FSTT research work; (2) assess the error embedded in the full data collection procedure; and (3) conduct validation testing of FSTT means proposed for point estimation prior to publication to ensure newly calculated FSTT means provide improvements. In order to facilitate the latter, a freely available R tool TDValidator that uses the C-Table data for validation testing is provided.",
