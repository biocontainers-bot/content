summary: rapid and memory-efficient system for classification of DNA sequences
description: >
  Centrifuge is a very rapid and memory-efficient system for the
  classification of DNA sequences from microbial samples, with better
  sensitivity than and comparable accuracy to other leading systems. The
  system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler
  transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized
  specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge
  requires a relatively small index (e.g., 4.3 GB for ~4,100 bacterial
  genomes) yet provides very fast classification speed, allowing it to
  process a typical DNA sequencing run within an hour. Together these
  advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data
  sets on conventional desktop computers.
