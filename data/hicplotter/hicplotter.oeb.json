Various factors including regulators of pluripotency, long non-coding RNAs, or the presence of architectural proteins have been implicated in regulation and assembly of the chromatin architecture. Therefore, comprehensive visualization of this multi-faceted structure is important to unravel the connections between nuclear architecture and transcriptional regulation. Here, we present an easy-to-use open-source visualization tool, HiCPlotter, to facilitate juxtaposition of Hi-C matrices with diverse genomic assay outputs, as well as to compare interaction matrices between various conditions.",
