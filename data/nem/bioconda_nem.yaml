description: The package 'nem' allows to reconstruct features of pathways from the
  nested structure of perturbation effects. It takes as input (1.) a set of pathway
  components, which were perturbed, and (2.) phenotypic readout of these perturbations
  (e.g. gene expression, protein expression). The output is a directed graph representing
  the phenotypic hierarchy.
