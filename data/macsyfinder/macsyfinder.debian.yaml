summary: detection of macromolecular systems in protein datasets
description: >
  MacSyFinder is a program to model and detect macromolecular systems,
  genetic pathways... in protein datasets. In prokaryotes, these systems
  have often evolutionarily conserved properties: they are made of conserved
  components, and are encoded in compact loci (conserved genetic architecture).
  The user models these systems with MacSyFinder to reflect these conserved
  features, and to allow their efficient detection
  .
  This package presents the Open Source Java API to biological databases
  and a series of mostly sequence-based algorithms.
version: 1.0.5
