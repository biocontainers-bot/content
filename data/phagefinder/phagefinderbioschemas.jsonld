  "sc:description": "It was created to identify prophage regions in completed bacterial genomes. Using a test dataset of 42 bacterial genomes whose prophages have been manually identified, It found 91% of the regions, resulting in 7% false positive and 9% false negative prophages. \nThe goal of this project is to provide an open-sourced, standardized and automated system to identify and classify prophages within prokaryotic genomes.",
