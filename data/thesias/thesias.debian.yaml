summary: Testing Haplotype Effects In Association Studies
description: >
  The objectif of the THESIAS program is to performed haplotype-based
  association analysis in unrelated individuals. This program is based
  on the maximum likelihood model described in Tregouet et al. 2002
  (Hum Mol Genet 2002,11: 2015-2023) and is linked to the SEM algorithm
  (Tregouet et al. Ann Hum Genet 2004,68: 165-177).
  THESIAS allows one to simultaneous estimate haplotype frequencies
  and their associate effects on the phenotype of interest.
  In this new THESIAS release, quantitative, qualitative (logistic
  and matched-pair analysis), categorical and survival outcomes can be
  studied. X-linked haplotype analysis is also feasible.
  Covariate-adjusted haplotype effects as well as haplotype x covariate
  interactions can also be investigated.
