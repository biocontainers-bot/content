Administrative boundaries of resource ownership restrict control of data within domains of trust. The term `Cloud Robotics' indicates the use of network resources at the center of the network (or `Cloud'), while `Fog Robotics' involves the use of networked resources along the Cloud/Edge continuum (or `Fog').\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'cloud', 'fog', 'fog robot', 'robot'",
