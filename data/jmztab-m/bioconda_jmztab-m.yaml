description: "mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results\
  \ from\nmetabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to\n\
  provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a \nsimple way\
  \ to share and combine basic information. mzTab-M has been\ndeveloped with a view\
  \ to support the following general tasks. Facilitate \nthe sharing of final experimental\
  \ results, especially with researchers \noutside the field of metabolomics. Export\
  \ of results to external software,\nincluding programs such as Microsoft Excel and\
  \ Open Office Spreadsheet\nand statistical software / coding languages such as R.\
  \ Act as an output\nformat of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus\
  \ can \nproduce standardized result pages. Be able to link to the external \nexperimental\
  \ evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.\n"
