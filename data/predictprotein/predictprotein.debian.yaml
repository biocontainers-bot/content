summary: suite of protein sequence analysis tools
description: >
  PredictProtein is a sequence analysis suite providing prediction of protein
  structure and function.
  .
  PredictProtein takes a protein sequence as input and provides the following
  per-residue, or whole protein annotations:
   * secondary structure
   * solvent accessibility
   * multiple sequence alignments
   * PROSITE sequence motifs
   * low-complexity regions
   * nuclear localisation signals
   * regions lacking regular structure (NORS)
   * unstructured loops
   * transmembrane helices
   * transmembrane beta barrels
   * coiled-coil regions
   * disulfide-bonds
   * disordered regions
   * B-value flexibility
   * protein-protein interaction sites
   * Gene Ontology terms
version: 1.1.09
