It integrates well-established cognitive theory with contemporary computational methods. The companion Open Access article is available at https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01285-3 | You will need a Python interpretter (>= 3.6) along with the an installation of the psiz package (version 0.1.0) in your preferred environment. You can install the correct version of the psiz package using pip: pip install psiz==0.1.0. You can also find version 0.1.0 on GitHub: https://github.com/roads/psiz/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz",
