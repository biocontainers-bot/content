        "description": "A novel one-class classification approach to accurately predict disease-gene association in acute myeloid leukemia cancer.\n\nDisease causing gene identification is considered as an important step towards drug design and drug discovery. In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'One-class Classification Support Vector Machines', 'OCSVM method'",
