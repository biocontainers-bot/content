summary: Fast Imputation Based on State Space Reduction HMM
description: >
  Minimac4 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient implementation
  of "minimac2/3". It is an algorithm for genotypic imputation that works on
  phased genotypes (say from MaCH).
  .
  Minimac4 is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more
  computationally efficient way with no loss of accuracy. This algorithm
  analyzes only the unique sets of haplotypes in small genomic segments, thereby
  saving on time\-complexity, computational memory but no loss in degree of
  accuracy.
