summary: Pretty-printing of multiple sequence alignments
description: >
  Boxshade is a program for creating good looking printouts from
  multiple-aligned protein or DNA sequences. The program does not perform
  the alignment by itself and requires as input a file that was created
  by a multiple alignment program or manually edited with respective tools.
  .
  Boxshade reads multiple-aligned sequences from either PILEUP-MSF,
  CLUSTAL-ALN, MALIGNED-data and ESEE-save files (limited to a maximum
  of 150 sequences with up to 10000 elements each).  Various kinds of
  shading can be applied to identical/similar residues. Output is written
  to screen or to a file in the following formats: ANSI/VT100, PS/EPS,
  RTF, HPGL, ReGIS, LJ250-printer, ASCII, xFIG, PICT, HTML
version: 3.3.1
