The members of the genus Tupaia , which are colloquially referred to as the tree shrews, were first recorded in a sketch by William Ellis on a voyage with Captain Cook in 1780. Tree shrews are similar in appearance to squirrels, and their body weight ranges between 120-200 g. The natural habitat of the tree shrews consists of the tropical rainforests in South East Asia, where they feed on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates",
