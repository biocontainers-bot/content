The knowledge about the distribution of 4mC is helpful for understanding its biological functions. Although experimental methods have been proposed to detect 4mC sites, they are expensive for performing genome-wide detections. Thus, it is necessary to develop computational methods for predicting 4mC sites. Results In this work, we developed iDNA4mC, the first webserver to identify 4mC sites, in which DNA sequences are encoded with both nucleotide chemical properties and nucleotide frequency. The predictive results of the rigorous jackknife test and cross species test demonstrated that the performance of iDNA4mC is quite promising and holds high potential to become a useful tool for identifying 4mC sites. Availability and implementation The user-friendly web-server, iDNA4mC, is freely accessible at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iDNA4mC. Contact chenweiimu@gmail.com or hlin@uestc.edu.cn.",
