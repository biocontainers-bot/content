summary: align expressed RNA sequences on a DNA template
description: >
  The SIBsim4 project is based on sim4, which is a program designed to align
  an expressed DNA sequence with a genomic sequence, allowing for introns.
  SIBsim4 is a fairly extensive rewrite of the original code with the following
  goals:
   * speed improvement;
   * allow large, chromosome scale, DNA sequences to be used;
   * provide more detailed output about splice types;
   * provide more detailed output about polyA sites;
   * misc code cleanups and fixes.
