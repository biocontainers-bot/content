While RF-cloning is a powerful tool for the design of custom plasmids when restriction sites are not conveniently situated, manually designing the requisite primers can be tedious and error prone. We present here a web-service that automates the primer design process, along with a user interface that includes a number of useful tools for managing both the input sequences and the resulting outputs. RF-Cloning is free and open to all users, and can be accessed at http://www.rf-cloning.org. © 2012 The Author(s).",
