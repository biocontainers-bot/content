summary: Fast and lightweight tool for processing sequences in the FASTA or FASTQ format
description: >
  Currently, seqtk supports quality based trimming with the phred
  algorithm, converting fastq to fasta, reverse complementing sequences,
  extracting or masking subsequences in regions given in a BED/name list
  file, and more.  It contains a subsampling module to sample exactly n
  sequences or a fraction of sequences.
  .
  Seqtk supports both fasta and fastq input files, which can be
  optionally gzip compressed.
version: 1.3
