summary: iterative virus sequence assembler
description: >
  IVA is a de novo assembler designed to assemble
  virus genomes that have no repeat sequences,
  using Illumina read pairs sequenced from mixed
  populations at extremely high depth.
  .
  IVA's main algorithm works by iteratively extending
  contigs using aligned read pairs. Its input can be
  just read pairs, or additionally you can provide an
  existing set of contigs to be extended. Alternatively,
  it can take reads together with a reference sequence.
version: 1.0.9+ds
