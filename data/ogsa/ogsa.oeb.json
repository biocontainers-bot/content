Deregulation can be driven by a number of molecular events, including gene mutation, epigenetic changes in gene promoters, overexpression, and gene amplifications or deletions. We demonstrate a novel approach that identifies pathways of interest by integrating outlier analysis within and across molecular data types with gene set analysis. We use the results to seed the top-scoring pair algorithm to identify robust biomarkers associated with pathway deregulation. We demonstrate this methodology on pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data. We develop a biomarker in primary AML tumors, demonstrate robustness with an independent primary tumor data set, and show that the identified biomarkers also function well in relapsed pediatric AML tumors.
