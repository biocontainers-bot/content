NGSReadsTreatment can handle reads from any platform with the same or different sequence lengths. Using the probabilistic structure Cuckoo Filter, the redundant reads are identified and removed by comparing the reads with themselves. Thus, no prerequisite is required beyond the set of reads. NGSReadsTreatment was compared with other redundancy removal tools in analyzing different sets of reads. The results demonstrated that NGSReadsTreatment was better than the other tools in both the amount of redundancies removed and the use of computational memory for all analyses performed",
