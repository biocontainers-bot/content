The program takes into account local similarity, stem energy, and covariations to produce the common folding. It can handle all RNA types, and has also been adapted to align a new homologous sequence along a reference structured sequence. Results: Using different data sets, we show that CARNAC provides a good partial prediction for a wide range of sequences (16S ssu rRNA, RNase P RNA, viruses) with only two sequences. In presence of a whole family of sequences, we also show that CARNAC can be used to detect whether the sequences actually share the same structure. © Oxford University Press 2002.",
