  "sc:description": "The integrated haplotype Score is a measure of the amount of extended haplotype homozygosity at a given SNP along the ancestral allele relative to the derived allele. This measure is typically standardized empirically to the distribution of observed iHS scores over a range SNPs with similar derived allele frequencies. Extended homozygosity for haplotypes on a high frequency derived allele relative to the ancestral background is a signature of a positively selected sweep.",
