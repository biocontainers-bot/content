Experiments on simulated and experimental data show that this pipeline can achieve overall 97% accuracy in SNP detection and 94% in the finding of indels. All the detected SNPs/indels can be further evaluated by a graphical editor in our pipeline. inGAP also provides functions of multiple genomes comparison and assistance of bacterial genome assembly.
