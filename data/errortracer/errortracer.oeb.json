        "description": "an algorithm for identifying the origins of inconsistencies in genome-scale metabolic models.\n\nMOTIVATION:The number and complexity of genome-scale metabolic models is steadily increasing, empowered by automated model-generation algorithms. The quality control of the models, however, has always remained a significant challenge, the most fundamental being reactions incapable of carrying flux. Numerous automated gap-filling algorithms try to address this problem, but can rarely resolve all of a model's inconsistencies. The need for fast inconsistency checking algorithms has also been emphasized with the recent community push for automated model-validation before model publication. Previously, we wrote a graphical software to allow the modeller to solve the remaining errors manually. Nevertheless, model size and complexity remained a hindrance to efficiently tracking origins of inconsistency.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
