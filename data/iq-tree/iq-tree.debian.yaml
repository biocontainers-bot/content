summary: efficient phylogenetic software by maximum likelihood
description: >
  IQ-TREE is a very efficient maximum likelihood phylogenetic software
  with following key features among others:
  .
   * A novel fast and effective stochastic algorithm to estimate maximum
     likelihood trees. IQ-TREE outperforms both RAxML and PhyML in terms
     of likelihood while requiring similar amount of computing time (see
     Nguyen et al., 2015)
   * An ultrafast bootstrap approximation to assess branch supports (see
     Minh et al., 2013).
   * A wide range of substitution models for binary, DNA, protein, codon,
     and morphological alignments.
   * Ultrafast model selection for all data types, 10 to 100 times faster
     than jModelTest and ProtTest.
   * Finding best partition scheme like PartitionFinder.
   * Partitioned models with mixed data types for phylogenomic (multi-
     gene) alignments, allowing for separate, proportional, or joint
     branch lengths among genes.
   * Supporting the phylogenetic likelihod library (PLL) (see Flouri et
     al., 2014)
