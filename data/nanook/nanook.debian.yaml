summary: pre- and post-alignment analysis of nanopore sequencing data
description: >
  NanoOK is a flexible, multi-reference software for pre- and post-
  alignment analysis of nanopore sequencing data, quality and error
  profiles.
  .
  NanoOK (pronounced na-nook) is a tool for extraction, alignment and
  analysis of Nanopore reads. NanoOK will extract reads as FASTA or FASTQ
  files, align them (with a choice of alignment tools), then generate a
  comprehensive multi-page PDF report containing yield, accuracy and
  quality analysis. Along the way, it generates plain text files which can
  be used for further analysis, as well as graphs suitable for inclusion
  in presentations and papers.
