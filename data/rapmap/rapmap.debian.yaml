summary: rapid sensitive and accurate DNA read mapping via quasi-mapping
description: >
  RapMap is a testing ground for ideas in quasi-mapping / (lightweight /
  pseudo) transcriptome alignment. That means that, at this point, it is
  somewhat experimental. The develop branch will have the latest
  improvements and additions, but is not guaranteed to be stable between
  commits. Breaking changes to the master branch will be accompanied by a
  tag to the version before the breaking change. Currently, RapMap is a
  stand-alone quasi-mapper that can be used with other tools. It is also
  being used as part of Sailfish and Salmon. Eventually, the hope is to
  create and stabilize an API so that it can be used as a library from
  other tools.
  .
  Quasi-mapping / (lightweight / pseudo)-alignment is the term that is
  used here for the type of information required for certain tasks (e.g.
  transcript quantification) that is less "heavyweight" than what is
  provided by traditional alignment. For example, one may only need to
  know the transcripts / contigs to which a read aligns and, perhaps, the
  position within those transcripts rather than the optimal alignment and
  base-for-base CIGAR string that aligns the read and substring of the
  transcript. For details on RapMap (quasi-mapping in particular), please
  check out the associated paper. Note: RapMap implements both quasi-
  mapping and pseudo-alignment (originally introduced in Bray et al.
  2016), these two are not the same thing. They are distinct concepts, and
  RapMap simply happens to implement algorithms for computing both.
