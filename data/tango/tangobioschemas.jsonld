  "sc:description": "A computer algorithm for prediction of aggregating regions in unfolded polypeptide chains. The model used here, is designed to predict cross-beta aggregation in peptides and denatured proteins and consists of a phase-space encompassing the random coil and 4 possible structural states: beta-turn, alpha-helix, beta-sheet aggregation and alpha-helical aggregation.",
