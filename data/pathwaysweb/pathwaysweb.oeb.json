Summary: PathwaysWeb is a resource-based, well-documented web system that provides publicly available information on genes, biological pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, gene-gene interaction networks (importantly, with the directionality of interactions) and links to key-related PubMed documents. The PathwaysWeb API simplifies the construction of applications that need to retrieve and interrelate information across multiple, pathway-related data types from a variety of original data sources. PathwaysBrowser is a companion website that enables users to explore the same integrated pathway data. The PathwaysWeb system facilitates reproducible analyses by providing access to all versions of the integrated datasets. Although its GO subsystem includes data for mouse, PathwaysWeb currently focuses on human data. However, pathways for mouse and many other species can be inferred with a high success rate from human pathways. Availability and implementation: PathwaysWeb can be accessed via the Internet at http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/PathwaysWeb:Overview. Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
