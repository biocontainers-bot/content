Sequencing is widely used, and generates very large amounts of data, mainly due to reduced cost and advanced technologies. Quickly assessing the quality of giga-to-tera base levels of sequencing data has become a routine but important task. Identification and elimination of low-quality sequence data is crucial for reliability of downstream analysis results. There is a need for a high-speed tool that uses optimized parallel programming for batch processing and simply gauges the quality of sequencing data from multiple datasets independent of any other processing steps. RESULTS:FQStat is a stand-alone, platform-independent software tool that assesses the quality of FASTQ files using parallel programming",
