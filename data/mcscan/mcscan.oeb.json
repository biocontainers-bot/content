        "description": "This software provides a clustering module for viewing the relationship of colinear segments in multiple genomes (or heavily redundant genomes). It takes the predicted pairwise segments from dynamic programming (DAGchainer in particular) and then try to build consensus segments from a set of related, overlapping segments.",
