The full guideline and executive summary including auditable outcomes are freely available on the SOMANZ website [https://www.somanz.org/guidelines.asp]. The guideline includes a proposed SOMANZ definition of NVP and HG and evidence-based practical advice regarding the investigation and management of NVP, HG and associated conditions including thyroid dysfunction. A practical algorithm for assessment and management as well as an individual patient management plan and self-assessment tools are included.",

We took the broadest definition of sepsis, including the investigation of viral and non-infectious sepsis. We have included three short easy diagnostic criteria for the triage of the acute patient: Respiratory rate, Systolic Blood Pressure and Alert/non-alert which trigger a management pathway.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'auditable'",
