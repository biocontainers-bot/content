We present an open-source, general-purpose tool that represents both query and database sequences by profile hidden Markov models (HMMs): 'HMM-HMM-based lightning-fast iterative sequence search' (HHblits; http://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/hhblits/). Compared to the sequence-search tool PSI-BLAST, HHblits is faster owing to its discretized-profile prefilter, has 50-100% higher sensitivity and generates more accurate alignments. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

In benchmarks it achieves better runtimes than other iterative sequence search methods such as PSI-BLAST or HMMER3 by using a fast prefilter based on profile-profile comparison. Furthermore, it greatly improves upon PSI-BLAST and HMMER3 in terms of sensitivity/selectivity and alignment quality.",
