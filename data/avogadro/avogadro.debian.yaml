summary: Molecular Graphics and Modelling System
description: >
  Avogadro is a molecular graphics and modelling system targeted at molecules
  and biomolecules.  It can visualize properties like molecular orbitals or
  electrostatic potentials and features an intuitive molecular builder.
  .
  Features include:
   * Molecular modeller with automatic force-field based geometry optimization
   * Molecular Mechanics including constraints and conformer searches
   * Visualization of molecular orbitals and general isosurfaces
   * Visualization of vibrations and plotting of vibrational spectra
   * Support for crystallographic unit cells
   * Input generation for the Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO quantum chemistry
     packages
   * Flexible plugin architecture and Python scripting
  .
  File formats Avogadro can read include PDB, XYZ, CML, CIF, Molden, as well as
  Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO output.
version: 1.93.0
