            "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common exploratory tool used to evaluate large complex data sets. The resulting lower-dimensional representations are often valuable for pattern visualization, clustering, or classification of the data. However, PCA cannot be applied directly to many-omics data sets generated by newer technologies such as label-free mass spectrometry due to large numbers of non-random missing values. Here we present a sequential projection pursuit PCA (sppPCA) method for defining principal components in the presence of missing data. Our results demonstrate that this approach generates robust and informative low-dimensional data representations compared to commonly used imputation approaches.",
