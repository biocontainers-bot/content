Indel detection using next-gen data is difficult and identification of long structural variations is extremely challenging. Results: We present Pindel, a pattern growth approach, to detect breakpoints of large deletions and medium-sized insertions from paired-end short reads. We use both simulated reads and real data to demonstrate the efficiency of the computer program and accuracy of the results. © The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.",
