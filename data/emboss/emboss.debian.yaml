summary: European molecular biology open software suite
description: >
  EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
  the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
  automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
  transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
  libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
  scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
  also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
  analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
  commercial software packages.
