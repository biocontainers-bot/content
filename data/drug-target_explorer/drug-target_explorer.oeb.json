            "abstract": "© 2018, The Author(s). Modern phenotypic high-throughput screens (HTS) present several challenges including identifying the target(s) that mediate the effect seen in the screen, characterizing ‘hits’ with a polypharmacologic target profile, and contextualizing screen data within the large space of drugs and screening models. To address these challenges, we developed the Drug–Target Explorer. This tool allows users to query molecules within a database of experimentally-derived and curated compound-target interactions to identify structurally similar molecules and their targets. It enables network-based visualizations of the compound-target interaction space, and incorporates comparisons to publicly-available in vitro HTS datasets. Furthermore, users can identify molecules using a query target or set of targets. The Drug Target Explorer is a multifunctional platform for exploring chemical space as it relates to biological targets, and may be useful at several steps along the drug development pipeline including target discovery, structure–activity relationship, and lead compound identification studies.",
