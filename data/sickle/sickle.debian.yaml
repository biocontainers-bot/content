summary: windowed adaptive trimming tool for FASTQ files using quality
description: >
  Most modern sequencing technologies produce reads that have deteriorating
  quality towards the 3'-end. Incorrectly called bases here negatively impact
  assembles, mapping, and downstream bioinformatics analyses.
  .
  Sickle is a tool that uses sliding windows along with quality and length
  thresholds to determine when quality is sufficiently low to trim the 3'-end
  of reads. It will also discard reads based upon the length threshold. It takes
  the quality values and slides a window across them whose length is 0.1 times
  the length of the read. If this length is less than 1, then the window is set
  to be equal to the length of the read. Otherwise, the window slides along the
  quality values until the average quality in the window drops below the
  threshold. At that point the algorithm determines where in the window the drop
  occurs and cuts both the read and quality strings there. However, if the cut
  point is less than the minimum length threshold, then the read is discarded
  entirely.
  .
  Sickle supports four types of quality values: Illumina, Solexa, Phred, and
  Sanger. Note that the Solexa quality setting is an approximation (the actual
  conversion is a non-linear transformation). The end approximation is close.
  .
  Sickle also supports gzipped file inputs.
