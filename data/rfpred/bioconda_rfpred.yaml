description: Based on external numerous data files where rfPred scores are pre-calculated
  on all genomic positions of the human exome, the package gives rfPred scores to
  missense variants identified by the chromosome, the position (hg19 version), the
  referent and alternative nucleotids and the uniprot identifier of the protein. Note
  that for using the package, the user has to be connected on the Internet or to download
  the TabixFile and index (approximately 3.3 Go).
