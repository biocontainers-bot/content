This calls for flexibility when setting thresholds for calling gains and losses. In addition, sample normalization can induce artifacts in the copy-number ratios for the non-changed genomic elements in the tumor samples. Results: We present an open source R package, Rseg, which allows the user to define sample-specific thresholds to call gains and losses. It also allows the user to correct for normalization artifacts. Â© The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
