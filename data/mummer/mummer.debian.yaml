summary: Efficient sequence alignment of full genomes
description: >
  MUMmer is a system for rapidly aligning entire genomes, whether
  in complete or draft form. For example, MUMmer 3.0 can find all
  20-basepair or longer exact matches between a pair of 5-megabase genomes
  in 13.7 seconds, using 78 MB of memory, on a 2.4 GHz Linux desktop
  computer. MUMmer can also align incomplete genomes; it handles the 100s
  or 1000s of contigs from a shotgun sequencing project with ease, and
  will align them to another set of contigs or a genome using the NUCmer
  program included with the system. If the species are too divergent for
  DNA sequence alignment to detect similarity, then the PROmer program
  can generate alignments based upon the six-frame translations of both
  input sequences.
