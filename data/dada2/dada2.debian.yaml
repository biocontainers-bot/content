summary: sample inference from amplicon sequencing data
description: >
  The dada2 package contributes to software workflows to interpret
  sequencing data from microbiota - the relative abundance of
  bacterial and/or yeast, typically measured in the gut.
  It infers exact amplicon sequence
  variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon sequencing data,
  replacing the coarser and less accurate OTU clustering approach.
  The dada2 pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq files, and
  outputs the sequence variants and their sample-wise abundances
  after removing substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
  classification is available via a native implementation of the RDP
  naive Bayesian classifier, and species-level assignment to 16S
  rRNA gene fragments by exact matching.
