  "sc:description": "A fast and flexible fragment chainer that supports linear and sum-of-pair gap costs and uses highly time-efficient index structure, i.e., Johnson priority queues and range trees padded with Johnson priority queues. Chaining of short match fragments helps to quickly and accurately identify region of synteny that may not be found using common local alignment heuristics alone.",
