All rights reserved.XIBD performs pairwise relatedness mapping on the X chromosome using dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from either SNP chips or next generation sequencing data. It correctly accounts for the difference in chromosomal numbers between males and females and estimates global relatedness as well as regions of the genome that are identical by descent (IBD). XIBD also generates novel graphical summaries of all pairwise IBD tracts for a cohort making it very useful for disease locus mapping. Availability and implementation: XIBD is written in R/Rcpp and executed from shell scripts that are freely available from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/XIBD along with accompanying reference datasets.",
