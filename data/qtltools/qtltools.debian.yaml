summary: Tool set for molecular QTL discovery and analysis
description: >
  QTLtools is a tool set for molecular Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) discovery
  and analysis. It allows user to go from the raw sequence data to collection of
  molecular QTL in few easy-to-perform steps. QTLtools contains multiple methods
  to prepare the data, to discover proximal and distal molecular QTL and to
  finally integrate them with GWAS variants and functional annotations of the
  genome.
version: 1.2
