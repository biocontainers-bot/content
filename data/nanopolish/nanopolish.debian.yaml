summary: consensus caller for nanopore sequencing data
description: >
  Nanopolish uses a signal-level hidden Markov model for consensus calling
  of nanopore genome sequencing data. It can perform signal-level analysis
  of Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. Nanopolish can calculate an improved
  consensus sequence for a draft genome assembly, detect base
  modifications, call SNPs and indels with respect to a reference genome
  and more.
version: 0.11.3
