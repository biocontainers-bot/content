description: Target capture experiments combine hybridization-based (in solution or
  on microarrays) capture and enrichment of genomic regions of interest (e.g. the
  exome) with high throughput sequencing of the captured DNA fragments. This package
  provides functionalities for assessing and visualizing the quality of the target
  enrichment process, like specificity and sensitivity of the capture, per-target
  read coverage and so on.
