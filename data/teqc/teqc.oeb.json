Quality measures comprise specificity and sensitivity of the capture, enrichment, per-target read coverage and its relation to hybridization probe characteristics, coverage uniformity and reproducibility, and read duplicate analysis. Several diagnostic plots allow visual inspection of the data quality. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
