Utilizing this method, it is shown by simulation that the application of multilocus DNA fingerprints to paternity testing is robust against deviations from idealistic assumptions made about underlying models and parameters. Partial homozygosity, allelism and linkage at the DNA loci involved, as well as variations in estimates of band‐sharing probabilities were studied for effects on the resulting paternity probabilities. None of the above‐mentioned phenomena appear to change these values to an extent relevant for decision making in paternity cases. Copyright © 1992 VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH",
