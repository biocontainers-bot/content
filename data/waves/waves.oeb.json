It provides an efficient way to implement a service for any bioinformatic software. Such services are automatically made available in three ways: Web pages, web forms to include in remote websites and a RESTful web services single application programing interface to access remotely from applications. In order to fulfill the service's computational needs, WAVES can perform computation on various resources and environments, such as Galaxy instances. Availability and implementation WAVES was developed with Django, a Python-based web framework. It was designed as a reusable web application.
