description: This LPE library is used to do significance analysis of microarray data
  with small number of replicates. It uses resampling based FDR adjustment, and gives
  less conservative results than traditional 'BH' or 'BY' procedures. Data accepted
  is raw data in txt format from MAS4, MAS5 or dChip. Data can also be supplied after
  normalization. LPE library is primarily used for analyzing data between two conditions.
  To use it for paired data, see LPEP library. For using LPE in multiple conditions,
  use HEM library.
