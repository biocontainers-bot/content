However, directly using all available in vitro assays in a model is usually impractical and inefficient. On the other hand, mechanistic knowledge has always been critical for toxicological evaluations and should not be ignored even with the increasing availability of data. In this paper, we illustrate a promising approach to integrating mechanistic knowledge with multiple data sources for in vitro assays, using drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as an example. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was used as a source for mechanistic knowledge and as a selection tool for high throughput predictors.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AOPwiki'",
