The degeneracy of the primer is the number of unique sequence combinations it contains. We study the problem of designing a pair of primers with prescribed degeneracy that match a maximum number of given input sequences. Such problems occur, for example, when studying a family of genes that is known only in part or is known in a related species. We discuss the complexity of several versions of the problem and give approximation algorithms for one simplified variant. On the basis of these algorithms, we developed a program called HYDEN for designing highly degenerate primers for a set of genomic sequences. We describe HYDEN, and report on its success in several applications for identifying olfactory receptor genes in mammals. Â© Humana Press.",
