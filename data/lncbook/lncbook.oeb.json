            "abstract": "© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.In recent years, the number of human long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have been identified has increased exponentially. However, these lncRNAs are poorly annotated compared to protein-coding genes, posing great challenges for a better understanding of their functional significance and elucidating their complex functioning molecular mechanisms. Here we employ both community and expert curation to yield a comprehensive collection of human lncRNAs and their annotations. Specifically, LncRNAWiki (http://lncrna.big.ac.cn/index.php/Main_Page) uses a wiki-based community curation model, thus showing great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge, while LncBook (http://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncbook) is an expert curation–based database that provides a complement to LncRNAWiki. LncBook features a comprehensive collection of human lncRNAs and a systematic curation of lncRNAs by multi-omics data integration, functional annotation, and disease association. These protocols provide step-by-step instructions on how to browse and search a specific lncRNA and how to obtain a range of related information including expression, methylation, variation, function, and disease association. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
