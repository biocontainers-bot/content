summary: scanning DNA sequence with a position weight matrix
description: >
  The TFBS perl modules comprise a set of routines to interact with the
  Transfac and Jaspar databases that describe a special family of proteins,
  the transcription factors. These bind to genomic DNA to initiate (or
  prevent) the readout of a gene.  Once multiple binding sites are known
  for a transcription factor, these are gathered in a single file and are
  aligned in order to find position-specific characteristica that might
  be used to predict such binding events in novel DNA sequences.

  Note: the TFBS perl module is no longer under active development.  All the
  functionality can be found in the TFBSTools Bioconductor package; users are
  highly encouraged to switch.  <http://bioconductor.org/packages/TFBSTools/>
