We have developed an expert system computer program, MultiMap, which automates this step−by−step procedure. MultiMap is based on a novel map construction algorithm and allows investigator control of marker locus characteristics, such as informativeness, scorability or distance to nearest neighbours. We used MultiMap to construct a human genetic map at an average resolution of 6 cM, using published genotypes at 1266 microsatelhto markers, and further extended this map by adding 397 VNTR and polymorphic gene markers. © 1994 Nature Publishing Group.",
