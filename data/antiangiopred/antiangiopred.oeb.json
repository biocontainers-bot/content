            "abstract": "Â© 2015 Ettayapuram Ramaprasad et al.The process of angiogenesis is a vital step towards the formation of malignant tumors. Antiangiogenic peptides are therefore promising candidates in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we have collected anti-angiogenic peptides from the literature and analyzed the residue preference in these peptides. Residues like Cys, Pro, Ser, Arg, Trp, Thr and Gly are preferred while Ala, Asp, Ile, Leu, Val and Phe are not preferred in these peptides. There is a positional preference of Ser, Pro, Trp and Cys in the N terminal region and Cys, Gly and Arg in the C terminal region of anti-angiogenic peptides. Motif analysis suggests the motifs \"CG-G\", \"TC\", \"SC\", \"SP-S\", etc., which are highly prominent in anti-angiogenic peptides. Based on the primary analysis, we developed prediction models using different machine learning based methods. The maximum accuracy and MCC for amino acid composition based model is 80.9%and 0.62 respectively. The performance of the models on independent dataset is also reasonable. Based on the above study, we have developed a userfriendly web server named \"AntiAngioPred\" for the prediction of anti-angiogenic peptides. AntiAngioPred web server is freely accessible at http://clri.res.in/subramanian/tools/ antiangiopred/index.html (mirror site: http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/antiangiopred/).",
