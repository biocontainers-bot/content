            "abstract": "Recent research in the protein intrinsic disorder was stimulated by the availability of accurate computational predictors. However, most of these methods are relatively slow, especially considering proteome-scale applications, and were shown to produce relatively large errors when estimating disorder at the protein- (in contrast to residue-) level, which is defined by the fraction/content of disordered residues. To this end, we propose a novel support vector Regression-based Accurate Predictor of Intrinsic Disorder (RAPID). Key advantages of RAPID are speed (prediction of anaverage-size eukaryotic proteome takes <1 hon a modern desktop computer); sophisticated design (multiple, complementary information sources that are aggregated over an input chain are combined using feature selection); and high-quality and robust predictive performance. Empirical tests on two diverse benchmark datasets reveal that RAPID's predictive performance compares favorably to a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art disorder and disorder content predictors. Drawing on high speed and good predictive quality, RAPID was used to perform large-scale characterization of disorder in 200+ fully sequenced eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis reveals interesting relations of disorder with structural coverage and chain length, and unusual distribution of fully disordered chains. We also performed a comprehensive (using 56000+ annotated chains, which doubles the scope of previous studies) investigation of cellular functions and localizations that are enriched inthe disorder in the human proteome. RAPID, which allows for batch (proteome-wide) predictions, is available as a web server at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/RAPID/. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
