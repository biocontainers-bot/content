summary: global multiple nucleotide or peptide sequence alignment
description: >
   This program performs an alignment of multiple nucleotide or amino acid
   sequences. It recognizes the format of input sequences and whether the
   sequences are nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) or amino acid (proteins). The output
   format may be selected from in various formats for multiple alignments such as
   Phylip or FASTA. Clustal W is very well accepted.
   .
   The output of Clustal W can be edited manually but preferably with an
   alignment editor like SeaView or within its companion Clustal X. When building
   a model from your alignment, this can be applied for improved database
   searches. The Debian package hmmer creates such in form of an HMM.
