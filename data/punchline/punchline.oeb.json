        "description": "Identifying and comparing significant Pfam protein domain differences across draft whole genome sequences.\n\nMotivation: Short-read draft paired-end Illumina assemblies can be fragmented, contain many contigs and be impacted on by repeat regions, caused by mobile element activity within the genome or inherently repetitive gene structure. Annotating such assemblies for function and analysing gene content can be challenging if predicted genes are fragmented across contigs. Such a case can often occur within specific families of genes such as longer genes with repeating domains, genes specifying several transmembrane domains and of unusual nucleotide content. These genes can often be virulence determinants, therefore losing these specific types of data can seriously impact downstream studies.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LCrossman'",
