summary: de novo transcriptome assembler for very short reads
description: >
  Oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce
  transcripts from short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina,
  SOLiD, or 454 in the absence of any genomic assembly.  Oases uploads a
  preliminary assembly produced by Velvet, and clusters the contigs into
  small groups, called loci. It then exploits the paired-end read and long
  read information, when available, to construct transcript isoforms.
