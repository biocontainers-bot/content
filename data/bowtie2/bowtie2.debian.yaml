summary: ultrafast memory-efficient short read aligner
description: >
  is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads
  to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads
  of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good
  at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes.
  .
  Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint
  small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically
  around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes
