DIFFERENT) bio.tools/bison (Bison) | Brain tISue segmentatiON pipeline using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a random forests classifier | Abstract Introduction Accurate differentiation of brain tissue types from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a critical requirement in many neuroscience and clinical applications. Accurate automated tissue segmentation is challenging due to the variabilities in the tissue intensity profiles caused by differences in scanner models and acquisition protocols, in addition to the varying age of the subjects and potential presence of pathology. In this paper, we present BISON (Brain tISue segmentatiON), a new pipeline for tissue segmentation. Methods BISON performs tissue segmentation using a random forests classifier and a set of intensity and location priors obtained based on T1-weighted images",
