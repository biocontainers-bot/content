Paircoil2 achieves 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity on known coiled coils in leave-family-out cross-validation. It also shows superior performance compared with published methods in tests on proteins of known structure. Â© The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
