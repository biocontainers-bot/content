description: >
  QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis
  package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables
  researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with
  publication-quality figures and statistical results.
  Key features:
   * Integrated and automatic tracking of data provenance
   * Semantic type system
   * Plugin system for extending microbiome analysis functionality
   * Support for multiple types of user interfaces (e.g. API, command line,
  graphical)
  .
  QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of the QIIME 1 microbiome analysis
  pipeline. QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations of QIIME 1, while
  retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used analysis
  pipeline.
  .
  QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline.
  New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME 2 plugins. You
  can view a list of plugins that are currently available on the QIIME 2 plugin
  availability page. The future plugins page lists plugins that are being
  developed.
