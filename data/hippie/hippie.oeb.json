Summary: We implemented a high-throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting enhancer element to streamline the workflow from mapping raw Hi-C reads, identifying DNA-DNA interacting fragments with high confidence and quality control, detecting histone modifications and DNase hypersensitive enrichments in putative enhancer elements, to ultimately extracting possible intra-and inter-chromosomal enhancer-target gene relationships.
