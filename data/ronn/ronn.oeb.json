The study and detection of such disordered regions is important both for understanding protein function and for facilitating structural analysis since disordered regions may affect solubility and/or crystallizability. Results: We have developed the regional order neural network (RONN) software as an application of our recently developed 'bio-basis function neural network' pattern recognition algorithm to the detection of natively disordered regions in proteins. The results of blind-testing a panel of nine disorder prediction tools (including RONN) against 80 protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank shows that, based on the probability excess measure, RONN performed the best.
